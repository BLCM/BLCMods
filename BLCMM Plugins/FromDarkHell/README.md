## BLCMM Plugins
Every BLCMM plugin has its own directory and readme file.
To use a BLCMM plugin;
- Download the .jar file in the folder.
- Open BLCMM
- Go to the 'Plugins' menu
- Choose 'Add external plugin'
- BLCMM will warn you to only proceed for plugins whose author you trust, like FromDarkHell and [LightChaosman](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/LightChaosman) :D
- Navigate to your downloads folder, and select the .jar you just downloaded
- Restart BLCMM when it prompts you
- Your plugin can now be found in the 'Plugins' menu
 
### Notes
Plugins may not work for either game. 
This means that if you're editing a The Pre-Sequel file, you won't be able to use the plugin.
This works vice versa.

Plugins use the same data as the Object Explorer to perform their task.
If the data the plugin uses is not present, it will be greyed out.
Hover your mouse over the plugin to find out why it's greyed out.
You can download the missing data packages in 'Tools'->'Settings' in the 'Autoupdate settings' tab.
