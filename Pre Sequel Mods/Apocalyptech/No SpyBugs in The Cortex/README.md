No SpyBugs in The Cortex
========================

SpyBugs are ordinarily minor annoyances at worst.  When they spawn during a
Mutator arena match in The Cortex, though, they can become quite annoying,
since the arena won't continue until all enemies have been destroyed, and
the SpyBugs can be quite reluctant to decloak sometimes.  Which leaves the
vault hunters shooting desperately in the air, guided only by the minimap
and some sound effects.

This mod disables SpyBugs in The Cortex, so they won't spawn at all in
there.  That's it!
