TPS Movement Speed Cheats
=========================

This mod increases movement speed of all TPS characters (including while
crouched, and while in FFYL).  It also increases the jump height a bit, and
increases air control by quite a lot.  If you're looking to zip through
some levels like there's no tomorrow, this is for you.

Obviously this is quite cheaty; I've mostly just used it for easier testing
of my other mods.

Usage
=====

This mod must be imported into FilterTool/BLCMM with `Developer tools` ->
`Add single mod`.  Choose the file `TPS Movement Speed Cheats` and have at it!

Mod Construction / Implementation Details
=========================================

This mod is actually generated using a simple little Python script named
`generate.py`.  The script makes use of `hotfix.py` from Apocalyptech's
main BL2 mod directory.  You'd need to copy (or symlink, if you're on Mac
or Linux) `hotfix.py` into this directory in order to run the script.

Licenses
========

The `generate.py` script itself is licensed under the
[3-clause BSD license](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause),
which should be permissive enough to do just about whatever with.
