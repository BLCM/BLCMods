TPS Better Loot Mod by Apocalyptech
===================================

This mod aims to make loot in The Pre-Sequel "better" in general.  It's
essentially a cheat mod, intended for those TPS players like myself who
tend to play in Normal most of the time, dislike grinding, get bored easily
by the uninteresting and drab loot that typically gets dropped in-game, and
who often end up just resorting to Gibbed to be able to play around with
some better gear.  The goal, personally, was to get the loot drops in-game
to a point where I never felt tempted to open up Gibbed.

The mod must be loaded into BLCMM, and nearly all of the mod can be toggled
on or off inside BLCMM as you'd hope, on an item-by-item basis.  Basically
every bullet point in the "Overview" section is its own "folder" once imported.
See the [Configuration](#configuration) section for the most obvious
configuration areas.

Compared to the BL2 Better Loot mod, rare loot has a slightly decreased chance
of dropping in this mod, but TPS gives you many more opportunities to drop
good loot than BL2 did, in general, especially starting about halfway through
the campaign.  Rooms with multiple epic+regular chests after boss fights, bosses
dropping multiple times from the same loot pools (you get two "Super Badass"
drops from the Zarpedon fight, for instance -- one for the mech suit and one
for Zarpedon herself), and an increased number of Badasses in general.  So
despite the nerfed drop rates, you may find this to be even more generous than
the BL2 version is.

Usage/Installation
==================

This mod must be imported into BLCMM using `File -> Import single mod`.
Simply choose the file `TPS Better Loot.blcm` and have at it!

Previous versions of this mod had various options, including offline and
standalone variants, but these are no longer provided.  BLCMM itself provides
all that functionality very easily now.  Even if you intend to use nothing
but this single mod, be sure to import into BLCMM and use the file that it
saves.

The previous "Lootsplosion" and "Reasonable" variants have been merged into
the single mod file, and you can now choose various aspects of the mod in
several "mutually exclusive" categories, meaning that you can only choose
one of the options in each.  This way you can tailor the mod to what you want
to do a little bit more easily.  See the [Configuration](#configuration) section
for more detail.

Mod Overview
============

*(Note that various behaviors in here can be changed by selecting from various
options in the mod file itself.)*

* Adds all legendaries + uniques (weapons, grenade mods, class mods,
  shields, oz kits) into the global "legendary" loot pools, so
  you'll start seeing those much more frequently.
* By default, loot will skew much more rare.  You should expect to see
  those legendaries/uniques far more frequently than in vanilla TPS.
* Glitch weapons spawn in the main game (though they will be more common
  in the Claptastic Voyage DLC)
* Luneshine weapons will drop in all world drop pools (this is identical
  to some functionality in UCP)
* Legendary/Unique weapons which allow Luneshine are guaranteed to spawn
  with Luneshine.  (Some legendaries/uniques don't have Luneshine set as
  possible accessories, so they will continue to not have Luneshine.  ie:
  Marek's Mouth, Cry Baby, Longnail, Heartfull Splodger, Cutie Killer, and
  a handful of others.)
* Makes Moonstones drop 2x more often
* Normalizes weapon type drops a bit.  *(Decreases pistol drop chance,
  increases all other weapon types.)*
* Lootable Container Changes:
  * "Regular" treasure chests will always provide at least blue-rarity gear,
    and have a decent chance of including stuff from the legendary pools.
  * "Epic" treasure chests have an extremely high probability of dropping
    from the legendary pools.
  * Moonstone chests are guaranteed to contain legendary loot.
  * When lockers spawn gear, they will always be blue-rarity.  *(Previously
    lockers had a chance to spawn even legendaries, so some could potentially
    see this as a drawback)*
  * Safes have been improved: Eridium configurations are far more likely, cash
    quantities have been improved.  Gear drop chances have been dropped
    somewhat, but gear from safes will always be legendary.
  * Fixes some "shield" loot configurations which had an error and would
    never spawn, previously.
  * Mutator Arena chests (from the mission l33t h4X0rz) have been improved
    *(though that hasn't seen a whole lot of testing)*.
  * Individual chest updates:
    * Zarpedon's Chest (from the mission The Secret Chamber) has been improved
      to pull from the epic chest pools.
    * The laser gun chest in the mission Picking Up The Pieces has been buffed to
      contain blue-rarity lasers instead of white.
* Boss drop pools are generally improved, and bosses are guaranteed to drop as
  many items from their unique drop pool as are in that pool.
  *(Though that can be configured easily.)*
  * Bosses with just a single unique drop will therefore be guaranteed to drop
    that item.
  * If a boss has more than one in their drop pool, you may get duplicates
    of one rather than one of each.
* Fixes/Changes to some enemies' drop poools:
  * Badass loot drops have been improved
  * Chubby drop pool has been improved.  *(Though the only chubbies in the
    game are Stalkers, so it's sort of hardly worth it.)*
  * Holodome Onslaught unique item drop probabilities have been improved.
  * Many enemies from the Claptastic Voyage DLC have a unique legendary drop
    associated with them, with a default drop rate of 0.1%.  This mod ups that
    probability to 1.5%.
  * Individual Enemy Drop Changes:
    * FlameKnuckle will drop from the badass pool even on playthrough 1.
    * Nel's drops have been improved (will pull from the Epic Chest pools)
    * Buffed the laser weapon drops from when Lost Legion Eternal troops start
      ascending to use the global drop pool instead of the enemy use pool.
    * Elder Opha and Virtuous Opha will drop from the badass pool.
    * Fixed Iwajira, Volcantis, and Odjurymir's pools so that the Hail has an
      even chance of dropping with everything else in their pool, as opposed to
      a greatly-increased chance, which is the default.
    * Added Zim and Min Min Lighter to Teh Earworm's drop pool, since you fight
      and kill it three times over the course of the You Can Stop The Music
      mission.
    * EOS/SH4D0W-TP's final loot shower has been tweaked to explicitly include
      glitch weapons, plus some extra moonstone and money.  The probabilities
      have been tweaked slightly so the loot shower will be likely to drop
      *fewer* weapons, though it'll still be a heck of a lot.
    * In the Holodome Onslaught, Powersuit Felicity and Flameknuckle's drops
      have been improved somewhat.
  * This mod technically nerfs a few enemy drops, which otherwise get a little
    too excessive even for me:
    * Hardcodes the drop probabilities for the unique loot dropped by Badass
      Kraggons and Tork Dredgers to pre-Better-Loot levels
    * Nerfs the drops from Felicity Rampant a bit (though they'll still be
      better than in vanilla TPS)
    * Drops from the Sentinel and Empyrean Sentinel (both raid and non-raid)
      have technically been nerfed so that the drops aren't completely absurd.
    * Bring Guard.Clapdog unique drops in line with the rest of the mod
* Remove early-game loot restrictions.  This is actually a superset of the
  similar feature already present in UCP 2.1.  This version enables spawning
  of basically everything from the beginning, including all grenade types,
  oz kits, class mods, rocket launchers, etc.  Both this and the UCP 2.1
  "Make good stuff drop earlier" mods can be active at the same time with
  no ill effects.  Note that if you *don't* have either this or UCP
  enabled on your game, the early game will end up dropping *no* gear, due
  to our rarity changes.
* An optional folder is provided to add some common-rarity loot chests
  near the dead drop location for the mission
  [To Arms!](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/To_Arms!) - that mission
  amusingly becomes quite difficult when using this mod, otherwise.
  Enabling this folder will make the OzKit-only chests near Deirdre become
  regular ammo chests, since we had to override that chest type to provide
  the weapons.

**NOTE:** I believe that due to our Legendary loot pool changes, Unique
gear will end up as possible Grinder results when trying to grind for
legendaries.

### Configuration

There are a few categories in the mod which are explicitly intended to be
user-changeable:

* **Remove Level-Based Loot Restrictions** - This is active by default, and allows
  basically all item/weapon types, elements, grenades, COMs, etc, from the very
  beginning of the game.  It can be toggled off if you'd prefer that to not be the
  case.  The mod actually unlocks a good amount of gear in the main section of the
  mod already, so many things will be unlocked whether or not you select this
  option.  This section is a copy of my own TPS Early Bloomer mod, though there's
  no harm in having both active at the same time.
* **Legendary Pool Improvements** - The default configuration adds all
  unique weapons/items into the main global loot pools, so all items can
  technically be found just about anywhere.  You can tweak which groups of
  items/weapons get added by going in here and disabling any you don't want
  to drop.
* **Drop Quality** - This is the main section which determines the quality of
  drops that you'll get throughout the game.  The choices range from "Excellent"
  (which used to be called "Lootsplosion," pre-1.1.0), all the way down to
  "Stock-ish", which is pretty close to the stock/vanilla TPS drop rates, though
  it's actually a *bit* better.  If you expand any of those categories, you'll
  see the exact percentages that it provides.  The default setting is Excellent.
* **Boss Unique Drop Rate** - This section lets you choose how often bosses drop
  their unique items/weapons.  The default setting is to make bosses always drop
  their unique gear, but it can be configured all the way down to the stock/vanilla
  drop rates.
* **Boss Unique Drop Quantities** - This section lets you define how *many* unique
  drops a boss will drop.  In the default configuration, if a boss has two unique
  drops, it'll drop two items from that pool.  It may end up being two of the same
  item, but it could also be one of each.  For enemies with huge loot pools, this
  can end up producing quite a few legendary drops.  For instance, the Empyrean
  Sentinel will drop four by default.  This section lets you specify the quantities
  you want, though, and can be configured to go back to just a single drop, as TPS
  does by default.
* **Provide Common Pistol Chests for "To Arms!" mission** - If you leave the gear
  quality buffed up, as it is in the default configuration, the mission "To Arms!"
  amusingly becomes one of the most difficult in the game, since common-level
  gear will be hard to come by, especially if you're using a mod to boost vendors.
  This category will allow you to choose to have four chests right next to the
  weapon drop, in Triton Flats, which each contain three common-rarity pistols,
  which should make that mission easy enough.  Doing so will make the OzKit-only
  chests near Dierdre turn into regular ammo chests.  If you don't select the
  common pistol chests, the OzKit-only chests will receive a slight bump in
  quality.

Compatibility
=============

### UCP ###

This mod is mostly compatible with UCP 2.1, even though UCP touches a lot of
the same objects that this mod does.  The few cases where we touch the same
data, our version is "better" in terms of the loot that it provides:

* This mod's `Better Enemy Drops -> Better Chubby Drops` overrides UCP's
  `Patch 2.1 -> Chubby SpawnRate and Loot -> Addition Of Holodome Com/
  Holodome gear 60% Random leg 30% to Chubbies`.  Our version is a bit
  more lootful.
* This mod's `Better Containers -> Better Moonstone Chests` completely
  overrides UCP's `Patch 2.1 -> MoonStone chests. Launchers 10% Longguns 5% ,
  Pistols GM,CoM,Shields 3%`.  Our version guarantees all legendaries.

Some instances where we touch the same objects but there's no real
compatibility issues:

* UCP improves the legendary pools as part of its Grinder changes -- this
  mod goes further and adds uniques to those pools as well.  The statements
  in this mod are supersets of the UCP statements, and shouldn't pose problems
  (except potentially for the Grinder giving you uniques in addition to
  legendaries).  Specifically, the following UCP 2.1 folders will get
  overridden by this mod:
  * `Patch 1.0 -> Grinder & world drop changes -> Add DLC legendaries to grinder`
  * `Patch 1.0 -> Grinder & world drop changes -> Add Rerouter & MORQ to grinder and world drops`
  * `Patch 1.0 -> Grinder & world drop changes -> Add meganade to grinder and world drop`
  * `Patch 1.0 -> Grinder & world drop changes -> Fix purple spike shields and remove purple from legendary pool`
* As mentioned above, our `Remove Level-Based Loot Restrictions` folder is a
  superset of UCP's `Patch 1.0 -> Make good stuff drop earlier` folder.  There are
  no problems with having both enabled, though -- they play nicely together.
* This mod's `Loot Pool Tweaks -> Luneshine Drops -> Enable Luneshine in World drops`
  is a duplicate of UCP's `Patch 2.1 -> 2.1 Optionals -> Make Luneshines Appear in
  the Wild`.  There's no problem with having both enabled.
* This mod will make most of the additional loot drops specified in UCP's `Patch 2.0 ->
  Loot changes 2.0` guaranteed drops.  Additionally:
  * UCP's `Make Rosie available in First Playthrough.  Make the Head available in all
    playthroughs` interacts a bit oddly with our changes there -- you'll end up getting
    two head drops, and will get the Rosie as a mission reward rather than a drop.
  * Boomer will drop a little too much loot in conjunction with
    `Boomer Removed Cradle of CP1`

### Other Mods

Obviously this mod will conflict with other mods which play with the same
variables, though I'm not aware of any in specific at the moment.

Loot Purposefully Excluded from Pools
=====================================

There's some gear which I felt shouldn't be in the pools at all.  I am
quite willing to hear counterarguments; my mind could probably be pretty
easily persuaded otherwise if someone feels strongly about it.

* Springs' Oz Kit
* Cracked Sash (Shield)
* Monster Trap (Grenade)
* The Contraband Sky Rocket grenade and "Probe" pistol *can* spawn, but
  have a much decreased chance compared to all the other legendaries.

There's also a few drop pools / containers / etc which I've purposefully
left alone:

* Golden Chest
* Cash Boxes
* Ammo Chests
* Cardboard Boxes
* Dumpsters
* etc...

Some other stuff not done:

* This mod won't touch the Grinder.  No point, really, given the rest of
  the mod, and there are plenty of other mods out there which already
  do that.
* Iwajira, Volcantis, and Odjurymir already had some extremely generous
  loot drops just in the base game, and this mod improves those even more,
  just on account of buffing the pools they drop from.  I've opted not to
  nerf those down.

Other Recommended Mods
======================

* My own "Luneshine on Uniques" mod will add Luneshine attachments to ten
  uniques/legendaries which don't otherwise support them.  Weapons generated by
  that mod will get deleted by TPS if its started up without the mod active,
  though, which is why I didn't include it here.
* Kazy's "88.89% Less Luneshine" is great for decreasing the visual effect of
  Luneshine, which I appreciate since there's so much more Luneshine in general
  when using this mod -- weapons all look too similar with the vanilla Luneshine
  effect.
* The UCP 2.1 option `Customs -> makevendorsGreaterAgain` will improve vendor
  stocks.

TODO
====

* Looks like we've omitted Heart Breaker from the available loot?  Perhaps I did
  that on purpose.  Take a look to see if there are other missing guns, and
  perhaps add them in...
* Configurable section for defining the rarity of loot in lockers?
* Maybe decrease Moonstone chest cost in exchange for not doing guaranteed
  legendaries on it?
* It probably wouldn't be difficult to nerf the drop rates while inside "slaughter"
  type arenas, which for TPS is just Abandoned Training Facility and Holodome
  Onslaught.

Other Notes
===========

As with the BL2 Better Loot mod, enemy drops can get rather excessive if you're in an
area which generates a lot of badasses, and The Pre-Sequel is already fairly generous
with loot.  The first fight against SH4D0W-TP in The Cortex can end up generating
nearly 30 good items (including the two glitched epic chests post-battle), which may
be a bit much to sort through.  Likewise, the later Holodome Onslaught levels are
just lousy with Badass-level enemies, and you'll end up with more loot than you'll
know what to do with.  In the interests of keeping loot interesting near the
beginning of the game, when that kind of excess is less common, I'm keeping the drops
the way they are for now, though I could probably be talked into nerfing things a
bit...

Mod Construction / Implementation Details
=========================================

*(This section is only relevant for someone looking to edit the mod in the
same way I do, or just someone curious about my mod construction techniques.
If you're just looking to run the mod, see the "Usage" section above.  The
mod can, of course, be edited directly in BLCMM as well, once it's been
imported.)*

I generate this mod using a Python script named `generate-mod.py`, which
enables me to do things like set the rarity drop levels from a single
location at the top of the file, and have it apply to a number of different
objects throughout the game.  The generation script makes use of
`modprocessor.py` from my BL2 mod directory.  You'd need to copy (or
symlink, if you're on Mac or Linux) `modprocessor.py` into this directory
in order to run the script.

Likewise, `generate-mod.py` makes use of some data introspection abilities
available in my FT/BLCMM Explorer project.  You'll need to copy (or, again,
symlink) FT Explorer's `ftexplorer` and `resources` dirs into this directory to
generate the mod.
