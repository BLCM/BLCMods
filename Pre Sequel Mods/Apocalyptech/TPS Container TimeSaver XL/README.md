TPS Container TimeSaver XL
==========================

Are you a busy, on-the-go Vault Hunter who just doesn't have the
*time* for such luxuries as waiting for loot chests to open?  Are
those Hyperion weapon crates leaving you tapping your watch and
sneaking glances at your day calendar?  Is the hunt for more ammo
filling you with near-terminal waves of impatience?

Well, fret no longer!  This mod increases the opening animations
of all containers in TPS by 5x.

Usage/Installation
==================

This mod must be imported into BLCMM using `File -> Import single mod`.
Choose the file `TPS Container TimeSaver XL.blcm` and have at it!

Bugs
====

Sound effects for the containers haven't changed at all, and still
use their pre-speedup timing.  So especially on the larger chests,
you'll probably get sound effects a second or two after the chest
is already opened.
