Apocalyptech's Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel Mods
===============================================

Guaranteed Phonic
-----------------

Guarantees the spawn of Phonic Kraggon (or Phuper Phonic Kraggon) in Serenity's
Waste.

Luneshine on Uniques
--------------------

Adds Luneshine attachments to several Unique/Legendary weapons which didn't
previously have them.  **WARNING:** This will generate weapons which TPS will
delete from your inventory, if it's started up without this mod enabled.

TPS Better Loot Mod
-------------------

This mod's general goal is to make loot drops in The Pre-Sequel "better",
as in skewing very much towards the rarer loot.  Legendaries/Uniques will
drop far more frequently than they do in vanilla TPS, glitch/luneshine
weapons will spawn in the main world, etc.

It's essentially a cheat mod, intended for those TPS players like myself who
tend to play in Normal most of the time, dislike grinding, get bored easily by
the uninteresting and drab loot that typically gets dropped in-game, and who
often end up just resorting to Gibbed to be able to play around with some
better gear.  The README in the mod dir itself should provide a lot more info.

TPS Movement Speed Cheats
-------------------------

This mod increases movement speed of all TPS characters (including while
crouched, and while in FFYL).  It also increases the jump height a bit, and
increases air control by quite a lot.  If you're looking to zip through
some levels like there's no tomorrow, this is for you.
