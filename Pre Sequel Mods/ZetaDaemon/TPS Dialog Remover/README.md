TPS Dialog Disabler
=============

Removes Dialog from the presequel, speeding up playthroughs a lot. If something is broken contact me at ZetaDÃ¦mon#1337 on discord.

Some missions might not let dialog be skipped so they will still play dialog. The current ones that have not been skipped are:
* Bunch of ice holes.

Changelog
=========
**v1.1** -
 * Removed "Bunch of ice holes" dialog skip.

**v1.0** -
 * Uploaded
