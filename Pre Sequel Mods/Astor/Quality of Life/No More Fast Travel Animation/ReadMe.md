## No More Fast Travel Animation

You all know the *Fast Travel/Respawn Animation*... 

![Fast Travel - Respawn animation](https://imgur.com/iUpx84M.gif "Don't worry guys... even if my screen capture show French text, my mods are in English")

At first, it's actually makes respawning fun... like "Please die again!"... but after few playtroughs, this become a little bit boring!

As the title suggests it, this Mod disables the useless (and annoying) *Fast Travel/Respawn Animation*!

### Help! The Mod doesn't work !?!

Read this little [Compatibility & Troubleshooting](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Pre%20Sequel%20Mods/Astor/Compatibility%20%26%20Troubleshooting) page... It's not that hard!  :wink:

### Credits & Thanks:

Inspired by [Travel Portal Disabler](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/blob/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/FromDarkHell/Quality%20of%20Life/TravelPortalDisabler.blcm) created for BL2 by [FromDarkHell](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/FromDarkHell). Such a Mod didn't seem to exist for TPS, though, so I took it upon myself to create one. All the credits go to [FromDarkHell](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/FromDarkHell) for the idea. 
  
### Note: 

Any critique would be appreciated as I am still beginner to make Mods... and by the way, please leave constructive criticism if you make a video. 
Enjoy!
