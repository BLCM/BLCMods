Is that the Moxxi's weapons skins in TPS? ... seriously? ... but not ever 2 skins are the same!?!

Argh! It's not pretty at all... Let's fix that!

First, I take the red color similar to the little *Cartier* box, next I made the metal part looking like (silver) steel... add some discrete decorative gold parts like the golden screws inserted into a brushed steel bracelet... finally adapt the Moxxi logo in a more appropriate size when necessary... and repeat the same work on all the Moxxi weapons...

Et Voila! Here is the *TPS - Moxxi Signature Elegance Collection*... and now the Moxxi's weapons are all uniform and look like an actual manufacturer.

### Changelog:
- v1.0.0, October 20, 2018
  - Initial public release
 
### Compatibility:

- 100% compatible with the latest version of [TPS Community Patch](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Pre%20Sequel%20Mods/Community%20Patch)

### To do:

- [x] Clean the code and remove all my ~~shitty~~ smart notes.
- [ ] Rotate some logo position (Heart Breaker, Creamer, Good Touch, Bad Touch)... but for now, TPS totally ignore my "DecalRotate" command :disappointed:

### Credits & Thanks:

Without the great [Dave'S BL2 Skin Modding Guide](https://cdn.rawgit.com/BLCM/BLCMods/bb1933f7/Borderlands%202%20mods/Dave/DAVE%27S%20BL2%20SKIN%20MODDING%20GUIDE.pdf) ... I won't be able to make any skin, so thanks for your great work, @DaveRabbit
  
### Note: 

Any critique would be appreciated as I am still beginner to make weapon skin... and by the way, please leave constructive criticism if you make a video. 
Enjoy!
