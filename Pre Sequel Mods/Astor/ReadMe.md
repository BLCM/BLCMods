## Bonjour

I'm Astor, and I apologize in advance for some grammar and/or syntax errors, but my mother tongue is French.

You are on TPS-Mods repository, where you can find all my Pre-Sequel (AKA Borderlands-The Pre-Sequel) Mods. (For the BL2 Mods, please go to the BL2-Mods section) 

This Read Me is just here as a quick synopsis, for detailed informations, each Mod has is own Read Me (and even a Changelog), so don't hesitate -whoosh!- to give a look on it.

## Skin Pack:

- **Moxxi Signature Elegance Collection:** the red similar to the little *Cartier* box, with discrete golden part inserted into (silver) brushed steel, this is the French elegance.
