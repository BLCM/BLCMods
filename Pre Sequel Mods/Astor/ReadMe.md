## Bonjour

I'm Astor, and I apologize in advance for some grammar and/or syntax errors, but my mother tongue is French.

You are on TPS-Mods repository, where you can find all my Pre-Sequel (AKA Borderlands-The Pre-Sequel) Mods. (For the BL2 Mods, please go to the BL2-Mods section) 

This Read Me is just here as a quick synopsis, for detailed informations, each Mod has is own Read Me (and even a Changelog), so don't hesitate -whoosh!- to give a look on it.

* * * * *

## To Read First: 

- **Compatibility & Troubleshooting:** a small reading information to clearly understand why a option or a fix in my mods don't work as intended, and how to simply fix it!

* * * * *

## Characters Change:

- ### All Characters:

  - **Throw Grenade in FFYL:** Now you can throw grenades while in FFYL.

- ### Aurelia 
  - ***Cold As Ice* in FFYL:** You can throw your *Frost Diadem Shard* (*Cold As Ice* ability) while in *Fight For Your Live*.

* * * * *

## Fixes:

- ***SuperNova* Missing Material Fix:** My modest contribution to fix the *Missing Material* bug which makes the *SuperNova* spawn with four different materials rather than just the predefined one and affecting the shield capacity, nova damage, and nova radius.

* * * * *

## Gears Improvement:
     
- ### Items Improvement:
  
   - #### Shields Improvement:

      - ***Black Hole* On Steroids:** Now, the singularity effect is very useful for drawing in enemies for a second wind, and can often kill common enemies in a single blast.

## Weapons Improvement:

- ### Assault Rifle Improvement:

  - ***KerBoom* with Singularity Grenade:** Turns the KerBoom into a useful weapon by
shooting 1 rockets, which spawn 1 singularity child grenade.

* * * * *

## Quality of Life: 

- **No More Reload Message:** Removes the (annoying) *Reload Message* which pop-up (too) often on the screen!

* * * * *

## Quest Change:

- **Less Tedious Quests:** Makes a few timed **-failable!-** optional mission less tedious to complete.

* * * * *
 
## Skin Pack:

- **Moxxi Signature Elegance Collection:** The red similar to the little *Cartier* box, with discrete golden part inserted into (silver) brushed steel, this is the French elegance.
