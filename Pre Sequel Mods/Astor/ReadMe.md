## Bonjour

I'm Astor, and I apologize in advance for some grammar and/or syntax errors, but my mother tongue is French.

You are on my Pre-Sequel Mods repository, where you can find all my TPS Mods. 

For the *BL2* Mods, please go to the nearest New-U Station and [__fast-travel to the *Borderlands 2 Mods*__](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Astor) repository. 

This ReadMe is just here as a quick synopsis, for detailed informations, each Mod has is own ReadMe (and even a Changelog), so don't hesitate -whoosh!- to give a look on it.

* * * * *

## To Read First: 

- __Compatibility & Troubleshooting:__ a small reading information to clearly understand why a option or a fix in my mods don't work as intended, and how to simply fix it!

* * * * *

## Characters Improvement:

- ### All Characters:
  - __Throw Grenade in FFYL:__ Now you can throw grenades while in FFYL, with any character.

- ### Aurelia 
  - __*Cold As Ice* in FFYL:__ You can throw your *Frost Diadem Shard* (*Cold As Ice* ability) while in *Fight For Your Live*.

- ### Jack:
  - __*DigiJack* in FFYL:__ You can summon your *DigiJack* to fight alongside you while in *Fight For Your Live*.

- ### Wilhelm: 
  - __*Wolf & Saint in FFYL:*__ You can summon *Wolf* (red combat drone) and/or *Saint* (white support drone) to fight alongside you while in *Fight For Your Live*.

* * * * *

## Custom Gears:

- ### Custom Items:

  - #### Custom Shield:

    - __*Black Hole* & *SuperNova* On Steroids:__ Since my *SuperNova*'s Missing Material Fix share the Black Hole's *Unique (predefined) Material* for these both shields, this Mod includes the *Black Hole* and *SuperNova*... and my stand-alone fix *Supernova Missing Material Fix* because it's mandatory to make this Mod working correctly.

- ### Custom Weapons:

  - #### Custom Shotgun:
  
    - __*Striker* Real Fandir Edition:__ Always fires thirteen pellets (Fandir? Thirteen), but deals significantly less damage per pellet. 

* * * * *

## Fixes:

- ### UCP 2.2 Fixes:

  - __Buff *Volcano* Fix:__ Corrects the faulty line of code in *TPS Patch 2.2.* to make the +50% Radius Damage (280 instead of 190) applying correctly.

- ### Vanilla Game Fixes:

  - __*Deadly Bloom* Legendary Fix:__ Corrects the *Deadly Bloom* Legendary bug by makes it regain his *legit* Legendary rarity, value & skin.
 
  - __*SuperNova* Missing Material Fix:__ My modest contribution to fix the *Missing Material* bug which makes the *SuperNova* spawn with four different materials rather than just the predefined one and affecting the shield capacity, nova damage, and nova radius.

* * * * *

## French Translation:

- __UCP 2.2 - French Add-On:__ a simple translation Mod that allows you to obtain in French any text additions (in English) from the Mod *UCP 2.2*.

* * * * *

## Moxxi Skins Packs:

- __Moxxi Signature Classic Collection:__ Based on *Creamer/Heart Breaker* vanilla skin, now the Moxxi weapons skins are uniformized to look like an actual manufacturer.

* * * * *
