## TPS - Moxxi Signature Classic Collection

Is that the Moxxi's weapons skins in TPS? ... seriously? ... but not ever 2 skins are the same!?!

That doesn't make sense to me... and it's just not prettier!

Where is gone the Orange/Red Fire color from the original BL2 *Creamer/Heart Breaker* vanilla skin ???

Let's go back to the original Moxxi's weapons skins with the *Moxxi Signature Classic Collection*, and now there are all uniform to look like an actual manufacturer.

### Changelog:
- v1.0.0, December 12, 2018
  - Initial public release
 
### Compatibility:

- 100% compatible with the latest version of [TPS Community Patch](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Pre%20Sequel%20Mods/Community%20Patch).

### Help! The Mod doesn't work !?!

Read this little [Compatibility & Troubleshooting](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Pre%20Sequel%20Mods/Astor/Compatibility%20%26%20Troubleshooting) page... It's not that hard!  :wink:

### To do:

- [x] Clean the code and remove all my ~~shitty~~ smart notes.
- [ ] Rotate some logo position (Heart Breaker, Creamer)... but for now, TPS totally ignore my "DecalRotate" command :disappointed:

### Credits & Thanks:

Without the great [Dave'S BL2 Skin Modding Guide](https://cdn.rawgit.com/BLCM/BLCMods/bb1933f7/Borderlands%202%20mods/Dave/DAVE%27S%20BL2%20SKIN%20MODDING%20GUIDE.pdf)... I won't be able to make any skin, so thanks for your great work, @DaveRabbit
  
### Note: 

Any critique would be appreciated as I am still beginner to make weapon skin... and by the way, please leave constructive criticism if you make a video. 
Enjoy!
