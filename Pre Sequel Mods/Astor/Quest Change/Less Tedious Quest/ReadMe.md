## Less Tedious Quest

As the title suggests it, makes a few timed and objective count **-failable!-** optional mission less tedious to complete:

### Objective Count Missions:

- ***Let Turrets Kill Scavs*** (during *Let's Build a Robot Army* multi-stage main mission) can be toggle from 12 to 10/8/6.
  

### Timed Missions:

- **Option #1: *Extended time***
  - ***Pop Racing*** in Triton Flats - Time limit increased to 3:00 (instead of 1:30)
  - ***Recruitement Drive*** in Triton Flats - Time limit increased to 9:00 (instead of 4:30)
  - ***The Don*** in Vorago Solitude - Time limit increased to 6:00 (instead of 4:30)

- **Option #2: *No time limit***
  - ***Pop Racing*** in Triton Flats - Time limit increased to 3:00 (instead of 1:30)
  - ***Recruitement Drive*** in Triton Flats - No Time limit 
  - ***The Don*** in Vorago Solitude - No time limit

**Note:** *Pop Racing* optional mission with double time (3:00 instead of 1:30) countdown... you can even fall in lava and grab a new car during the race, you'll still have enough time eat a picnic at the roadside before passing -winner!- the finish line!

### Credits & Thanks:

Inspired by [Quest Fix](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/blob/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/FromDarkHell/Quest%20Changes/QuestFix.txt) created for BL2 by [FromDarkHell](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/FromDarkHell). Such a Mod didn't seem to exist for TPS, though, so I took it upon myself to create one. All the credits go to [FromDarkHell](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/FromDarkHell) for the idea.
  
### Note: 

Any critique would be appreciated as I am still beginner to make Mods... and by the way, please leave constructive criticism if you make a video. 
Enjoy!
