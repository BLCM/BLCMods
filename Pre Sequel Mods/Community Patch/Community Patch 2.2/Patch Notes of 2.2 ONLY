19 Optional To double the Drop Rate GLOBALLY. 
PLZ FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO NOT USE THIS WITH THE DARKSIDERS DROPRATE NERF REVERT

20 Patch is now ORGANISED based on categories and not based on patch version 


And as a final Note i Need YOU the user to give me some feedback on something loot related.
 
As of Now i gave you the option to double the droprates in order to counter how many pools in TPS now have DOUBLE items
in em making em very hard at times to farm somethin specific ( like getting the shooting star and not the major tom )
BUT there is actually another way to go about it.
I can rework the whole system so every farmable source has TWO pools. both 10% meaning you ll have a chance at getting both
BUT the huge BUT is that dropping a Major tom will no longer eat up you Shooting star drop!

Gimme Your opinions Either on Discord on Jim Raven#3934 Or On my Youtube page ( Ravenjim93 NOT ravenjim) In the upcoming video 
about 2.2 change that ill upload sometime next week. (?)
