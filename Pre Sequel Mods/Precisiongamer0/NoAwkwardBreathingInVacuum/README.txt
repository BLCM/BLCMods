This mod is designed to remove the awkward breathing effect when you're in a vacuum in The Pre-Sequel, it works by replacing the audio trigger (akEvent)
and just setting it to none, this means that it can't effect anything else in the game.

The main reason why I created this mod is I knew a few friends who disliked hearing the breathing and I eventually got annoyed of it after a good amount
of hours in the game, so I removed it

Have fun!
