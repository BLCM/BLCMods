Inside of each named folder is legendary coms for that character. There will eventually be a legendary com for every skill tree/main build for every character in the game. There are usually 3 main builds per character (Ex. Fragtrap is explosive, allies/healing, or fragmented; Aurelia is sniping, cryo/ice, and aristocrat/servant).

The Grinder is the best place to find all legendary coms. Moonstone grind 3 purple coms of the same character and you will get a legendary com.
