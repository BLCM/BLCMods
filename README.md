# BLCMods

This is a repository for Community Mods made for the Borderlands series, specifically BL2 and BLTPS.

These mods should use the `set` command in the Unreal console to change in-game variables.
If your mod has specific considerations you should make it clear how to install.

Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/BL2CP/BLCMods/wiki)
