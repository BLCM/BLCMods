# BLCMods

This is a repository for Community Mods made for the Borderlands series, specifically BL2 and BLTPS.

These mods should use the `set` command in the Unreal console to change in-game variables.
If your mod has specific considerations you should make it clear how to install.

Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/BL2CP/BLCMods/wiki). If you want to find specific mods by category, check [repository with sorted mods](https://github.com/BLCM/ModCabinet/wiki)

## Requirements

These mods can only be installed on PC and will **never** be ported to consoles due to technical and legal limitations.    
All **non-headhunter** DLC is required for the patch and likely most mods.

support will most likely **NOT** be given for errors that the UCP cause due to missing DLC.

Individual mod support for errors is up to the author of the mod and is a case by case basis.

**DO NOT EXPECT TO BE *ENTITLED* TO HELP**, each member of BLCM and the discord is an individual first then a modder second, is doing this for free, and have (potentially busy) lives to live.

That being said most members of BLCM are more than willing to help if you remember this.

## Contribution

If you wish to contribute a mod:
