Arcania
=======
Arcania is a vanilla+ item pack that aims to improve the Borderlands 2 experience without interfering with the game's vanilla mechanics. Currently containing more than 70 weapons, shields, grenade mods, and relics, each with its unique mechanics! 

What to expect
==============
- 61 new unique weapons (13 assault rifles, 9 shotguns, 13 pistols, 9 SMGs, 9 sniper rifles, and 8 rocket launchers). Expand your arsenal and find dozens of new ways to blow your foes' faces off! Each of the items can be obtained from a certain mission, enemy, or lootable object, with a vast majority of legendary items being obtainable from all suitable loot sources.
- Signature gear! You will get a special item for completing the first mission of the game based on the character class you're playing as. Jump into Arcania with your character's first weapon!
- Non-unique Jakobs shields! Shields of the Jakobs manufacturer provide bullet deflection and reduce damage taken from deflected bullets. They're gonna think twice before shooting you again!
- Non-unique Jakobs grenades! Just like their weapons, Jakobs grenades feature high, non-elemental damage.
- 8 new unique shields
- 5 new unique relics
- 6 new unique grenade mods
- The mod file includes a spreadsheet with each item's drop source as well as an explaination of its mechanics.

What not to expect
==================
- Gear replacements. Everything added by Arcania is a brand new item that can exist together with vanilla gear. Everything obtainable in vanilla Borderlands 2 is also obtainable with Arcania from the same sources.
- Rebalances and character overhauls. Arcania aims to improve the vanilla experience without changes, nerfs, or buffs to vanilla balance. That includes unchanged vanilla skill trees.

Requirements and compatibility
==============================
- Arcania was made with and requires Command Extensions to create the new gear. Make sure to install that before running the mod.
- Sanity Saver is required for the gear not to be deleted on a save-quit.
- (NOT TESTED) While Arcania might run into compatibility issues with overhaul mods, its lack of balance changes should make it possible to run with mods that overhaul the game's mechanics without adding new items.
- Arcania is NOT compatible with BL2fix's boss loot changes (for example, making each item from a boss' pool drop as a separate instance), as they override certain loot pools which might make some Arcania guns unobtainable or harder to obtain. It is compatible with other changes provided by BL2fix.

Future
======
Arcania is a mod in a very early development stage. The gear might not be properly balanced, and there might be bugs or other issues I have missed. Feedback on balance as well as bug reports are greatly appreciated. In the future, the mod is gonna feature:
- Many, many more items!
- Class mods, both unique and non-unique ones
- Custom enemies
- Raid boss 'item sets' - each raid boss is going to drop four specific seraph items related to the boss' fight and mechanics. Three of those items already exist in the mod, but I'm not gonna spoil them :P
- More rewards for story missions, ensuring you get to experience the custom gear during every playthrough of the mod.

Big thanks to all the amazing people in Shadowevil's Discord server who helped me get into Borderlands modding and understand certain game mechanics! Arcania wouldn't exist without the help of y'all <3 <3 <3
