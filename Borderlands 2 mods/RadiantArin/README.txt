1. Foreword

Thank you very much for checking out the Radiance Modpack. This Modpack is meant to help Borderlands 2's issues with balance, lack of diversity with weapon/shield parts, changing and getting rid of some base mechanics, the reliance of Slag to get through the game, and several bug changes and glitches that were fixed.

This modpack assumes that you at least have a basic understanding of how to install and work BLCMM and SDK mods. If you don't know what that is, I suggest stopping here and checking out video tutorials on how to install BLCMM/SDK mods.

You can check out LightChaosman's tutorial on how to set up BLCMM: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkRgUqru3oU

And you can also check out Apple1417's tutorial on how to set up SDK Mods: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57WxvASCX70

2. Requirements

This mod requires the following SDK mods to run:

• Base Python SDK
• Command Extensions
• Sanity Saver
• Structs
• User Feedback

All SDK mods have been provided in the modpack for user convenience, however you can also go to https://bl-sdk.github.io/mods/ to get the mods you need. All other mods are purely optional.

3. Installation

• Unzip the contents of this package.
• Go to your installation folder. This will be in your ProgramFiles\Steam\steamapps\common\Borderlands2 or if you are running the Epic version ProgramFiles\EpicGames\Borderlands2.
• Copy and paste the contents of the unzipped folder directly into your Binaries folder (The Excel sheets are an exception).
• Go into your game and press the "`" key.
• Type "exec Radiance.blcm" (without quotes).
• Your mod is now up and running.

If you did everything correctly, you should see a popup saying the mod is running.

Note that if you do not have some of the SDK mods installed, the mod will not run. It is very important to have these mods installed in your Mods folder of your directory in order to run the mod.

DO NOT run this mod with any other large overhaul mods, especially other BLCMM mods. Some examples may include BL2Fix (SDK), BL2: Exodus (SDK), Azurelands (BLCMM), BL2: Reborn (BLCMM), and many others. Some modifications of the UCP (Patch) are also included in this mod, so do not run this alongside the UCP.

The mod creator, Arin, is not responsible for any bugs or glitches that result of opening and running multiple mods at once. Before reporting a bug, please test extensively to make sure it is within the confines of the Radiance mod, and not a mishap between two mods.

DO NOT run this mod offline. This requires the GBX hotfixes and Shift "Say" command, and running the game offline will cause it to crash.

DO NOT run this mod in multiplayer. Due to SDK cloning, functionality between players may not be 100%, and your friend may see something that you would not be able to and vice versa.

4. So what is changed?

If you've gotten this far, congratulations! There are a long, long list of changes that come with the Radiance modpack. As stated before, this is a modpack that helps change the balance and flow of the game to be more friendly. The biggest changes are:

• Raid bosses have had their health lowered, some of them have even had their mechanics changed altogether. 

• Weapon parts now actually mean something. For example, a Vladof Grip on an Assault Rifle will now give more reload speed and Fire Rate. The concept of "matching grip" or "matching barrel" does not exist anymore; a good combination of parts on a weapon will be more beneficial than just having one, absolute option.

• Character Skill Trees were revamped. This brings to light an entirely new playstyle for each Vault Hunter.

• New weapons, shields, Class Mods, and Artifacts. There are over 100 new unique items that are in the modpack, and some are in places you don't even realize.

• QoL mods like No More Bullet Reflection and Less Dumb Visuals help streamline the player experience to make it much more bearable and enjoyable.

• The modpack is fully customizable for every player experience! You can change how hard or how easy you want the game to be, as well as how often bosses drop their loot.
