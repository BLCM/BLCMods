Moneyshot Fix
=============

This mod finally fixes Money Shot! Yes thats right it's fixed, but you will need to install [Python SDK](https://bl-sdk.github.io/) and [Command Extentions](https://bl-sdk.github.io/mods/CommandExtensions/). Moneyshot now correctly checks for the mag size being less than 10 meaning it now also has the proper damage per level, as well as the damage for each hand is only checking the magazine size for the weapon in that hand, no more abusing jakobs shotguns in the offhand by having the grog in the mainhand, but now your offhand weapon doesn't have to get punished by the mag size of your main hand weapon.

Changelog
=========

**v1.1** -
 * Updated to be properly multiplicative to other gun damage bonuses like moneyshot is in vanilla as before it only added the % of gun damage so it was additive with other gun damage bonuses making in unintentionally weaker
