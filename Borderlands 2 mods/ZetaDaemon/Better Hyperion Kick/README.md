Hyperion Better Kick
=============

Changes Hyperion kick to be based on the accuracy impulse rather than the current accuracy, meaning the kick no longer changes while shooting but also no long bounces all over the place when you start shooting a Hyperion gun.

You will need to install [Python SDK](https://bl-sdk.github.io/) and [Command Extentions](https://bl-sdk.github.io/mods/CommandExtensions/) for this to work.
