## Skill Scaling Patch

The Skill Scaling Patch fixes a number of bugs or inconsistencies about the way skills scale with level, and across playthroughs. It is not meant to "fix" the balance of the game according to my personal preferences, but merely to make it work as was (most probably) intended. It does clearly improve some aspects of the balance, though. The skills that are the most affected are Ruin (Maya), Light the Fuse (Krieg), Deathtrap and all its damage abilities (Gaige), the Sabre Turret and all its damage abilities (Axton).

Concerning Deathtrap and the Sabre Turret, the main problem addressed by this patch was actually not present on console. With the Skill Scaling Patch, their damage output should thus be identical (or close) to what it is on console. And that makes a huge difference on their end-game viability.

## Skill Changes

Various changes to character skills, not (or maybe not yet) included in my Skill Scaling Patch.

**Phaselock Tweak** makes it so that Phaselock stays active for its base duration after hitting an immune target, so that Wreck / Elated / Chain Reaction give all their bonuses.

**Cloud Kill Dynamic Nerf** nerfs Cloud Kill, uh well, dynamically. That is, Cloud Kill gets nerfed *a lot* in the early levels, and *a lot less* (or pretty much not at all) in the end game. Several options are available.

## Elemental Banshee Maya

Elemental Banshee Maya is a complete rework of Maya's skills, pushing her into different playstyles, with a focus on elemental effect damage and melee (including some ranged melee abilities).

Many of the important skills in her vanilla configuration are taken away (e.g. Wreck, Reaper, slag on Ruin, Ward for easy Beehawking), and replaced by completely new skills with some interesting synergies.
Her health and health regeneration skills are boosted to allow for a more aggressive and close quarter gameplay, incl. with depleted shields.
Most class mods have been adapted, and some new ones (Legendary Banshee,...) are introduced. I recommend starting a new playthrough to build her progressively.

This is kind of a beta version: it is fully functional, but the balance is still not perfect and is subject to further changes, so check for updates.
Feedback on the matter would be appreciated.

## Other Stuff

**`fixUCPerrors.blcm`** This small mod fixes the few "overwrite" errors (the ones that appear in orange in the UCP when using BLCMM 1.1.6 in developer mode).
