# 1) Removed the level 72 cap: Light the Fuse, Krieg's innate melee damage bonus (without blade attachment)
# --> No effect on damage up to level 72
# --> Light the Fuse damage increased by up to +183% (OP8)
# --> Krieg's base melee damage increased by up to +6.6% (OP8)
#
# 2) Made damage scale like other skills: Phaselock (on non-phaselockable targets)
# --> Damage increase of +60% at level 30, +100% at level 50, +144% at 72, +160% at OP8. 
#
# 3) Made damage scale like other skills & removed level 72 cap: Ruin (explosions + DOT effects), Cloud Kill (DOT effect only)
# --> Damage increase of +60% at level 30, +100% at level 50, +144% at 72, +590% at OP8.
# --> This does not make Cloud Kill more OP, since the DOT is very small (overall damage increased by about +1.5% at OP8) 
#
# 4) Made Deathtrap's damage scale the way it was supposed to (and actually does, on console)
# --> Affects the base melee damage, and the damage from his skills (Explosive Clap, The Stare, etc)
# --> Damage decrease of -29% at level 5 (Normal), increase of +4% at level 30 (Normal).
# --> Damage increase of +110% at level 50 (TVHM), +156% at level 72 (UVHM), +173% at OP8.
# --> The multiplicative bonus on his roid damage from Sharing is Caring now depends on level:
#     Instead of a constant value of 1.4, it increases from ~1.5 at level 31 (Normal), to ~3.8 at OP8.
# --> Deathtrap now gets a bonus to his damage in co-op.
#     The max bonus (4 players) should be about +90% in Normal, and about +30% in TVHM/UVHM.
# All of this should now be exactly the same as it is on console.
#
# 5) Tried to make the Sabre Turret damage scale the way it was supposed to (and actually does, on console)
# Unlike Deathtrap, I couldn't figure out a way to do it perfectly, so I got as close as I could. I'll update if I find a better solution.
# --> Affects the damage of the bullets, the Scorched Earth Rockets, Nuke, and the capacity of the Phalanx Shield.
# --> The damage is now as it should be (and the same as on console) at level 0 (Normal), and at OP8. But it evolves a bit differently in-between.
#     Mostly: it gets about 30% too large at the end of Normal mode, and about 30% too small in the beginning of TVHM. 
# --> Turret bullets & part of the Nuke damage: -38% damage at level 5 (Normal), +14% at level 30 (Normal), +56% at level 50 (TVHM), +119% at OP8.
# --> Scorched Earth & part of the Nuke damage: -7% at level 16 (Normal), +43% at level 30 (Normal), +95% at level 50 (TVHM), +173% at OP8.
# --> Nuke Fire DOT:
# --> Phalanx Shield capacity is made to scale better, to stay (very roughly) constant relative to the turret's health. This is not the case on console.
#     -12% capacity at level 16 (Normal), +18% at level 30 (Normal), +61% at level 50 (TVHM), +125% at OP8.
# --> The Sabre Turret still does not get any bonus damage in multiplayer, as it does on console (like Deathtrap).
# --> One issue with this fix is that the damage of the turret is in part calculated from the level of the game, rather than the level of the turret itself.
#     For example, if you join the game of a lower/higher level player, your turret damage will adapt (to some extent), and be lower/higher than it should.
