
This folder contains mods that are related to Krieg

 #1. Mods to mess around with(aka they may be unbalanced and/or broken)


	1. HH.txt- makes it so that Hellfire Halitosis is affected by melee damage

	   kinda broken on Mania Hellborn, but Bloodlust Hellborn shouldnt be affected that much
		

	2. LtF.txt
	
	   makes LtF scale to OP8, and also increases the thrown dynamite's radius by 33%
	
	   you may want to disable the community patch's buff of LtF when using this.

 #2. Krieg Tweaks(fixes?)
 
 
	1. StV.txt- Included in Community Patch 3.0!
	
	   Silence the Voice's self damage is originally boosted by grenade damage, making it dangerous to swing your axe after activating Fuel the Blood
	
	   this makes it so that the self damage is no longer boosted by grenade damage(or anything else as far as I know)

	2. FlameFlare.txt- adds a 9% Burn damage reduction(not Fire damage, mind you) to Flame Flare
	
	   makes it so that burn DoTs from external sources such as enemies or barrels are less likely to kill you, since those DoTs are affected by the increased burn duration too
 
	3. Stacks.txt- Included in Community Patch 3.0!
	
	   Elemental Elation stacks and Salt the Wounds stacks shared a spot for being displayed, making it so that you could only see one of the two
	
	   this makes it so that you can see both

	4. KillSkillSlots.txt
	   makes it so that Blood Bath and Fuel the Fire are displayed in separate slots, thus preventing their overlapping each other.
 
	5. EtP.txt 
	   Embrace the Pain doesnt affect the fire rate of your thrown buzzaxes. The reason is that it is set to be deactivated when youre in Blood Axe Rampage
	
	   this makes it so that Embrace the Pain stays on while youre in Blood Axe Rampage, thus keeping your roid shield delay long and giving you faster buzz axe throwing speed
 
	6. BloodTwitch.txt 
	   turns Blood Twitch into a passive skill, but lowers the Swap Speed to compensate
	
	   so at 5/5 Blood Twitch, each bloodlust stack will give you 0.9% swap speed, meaning youll have 90% swap speed with 100 stacks
 
	7. BloodEuphoria.txt- last updated:4/25
	
	   Included in Community Patch 3.0 as a gamechanger! 

	   Blood Euphoria is an unused skill for Krieg which surprisingly had all the codes set up. basically, all it needed doing was putting it on a skilltree
	
	   so I put it on Bloodlust tier 4
	
	   Blood Euphoria: when killskills end, you heal 0.2n% per bloodlust stacks you have.
 
	8. RavingRant.txt 
	   already included in Community Patch since 2.0, so dont use it if you use Community patch 2.0 or above
	brings back Krieg's Raving Retribution lines.
	
	   already included in community patch so most of you should have no reason to download this
	
	   and no Im not stealing anything because Im the one who brought it back in the first place :P
 
 #2-1. Krieg Skins

 
	1. DarkLeaksOuttaMe
	
	2. PickTheScav
	
	makes each have a similar color scheme to Black As Day skin
	
	unfortunately has to be activated when youre actually using that skin, and in-game with that character.
