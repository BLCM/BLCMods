1. Mods to mess around with(aka they may be unbalanced and/or broken)

 HH.txt- makes it so that Hellfire Halitosis is affected by melee damage
 kinda broken on Mania Hellborn, but Bloodlust Hellborn shouldnt be affected that much

 LtF.txt- increases the final explosion damage by twice, and the thrown dynamite by 3.6 times but its also changed to rocket splash instead of grenade splash. also increases the thrown dynamite's radius by a bit
 intended for non-explosive Kriegs who still want to have some fun, using this with an Explosive Krieg will most likely be broken/op
 
 Nidhogg WIP.txt-currently WIP as the title says, changes the creamer to resemble the BL1 Nidhogg(aka fires a rocket that explodes after a set time, releasing 6 smaller rockets downward)
 removes the Moxxi healing as well
 havent worked on a skin yet
 
 2. Krieg Tweaks(fixes?)
 
 StV.txt- Silence the Voice's self damage is originally boosted by grenade damage, making it dangerous to swing your axe after activating Fuel the Blood
 this makes it so that the self damage is no longer boosted by grenade damage(or anything else as far as I know)
 
 FlameFlare.txt- adds a 9% Burn damage reduction(not Fire damage, mind you) to Flame Flare
 makes it so that burn DoTs from external sources such as enemies or barrels are less likely to kill you, since those DoTs are affected by the increased burn duration too
 
 Stacks.txt- Elemental Elation stacks and Salt the Wounds stacks shared a spot for being displayed, making it so that you could only see one of the two
 this makes it so that you can see both

 EtP.txt- Embrace the Pain doesnt affect the fire rate of your thrown buzzaxes. The reason is that it is set to be deactivated when youre in Blood Axe Rampage
 this makes it so that Embrace the Pain stays on while youre in Blood Axe Rampage, thus keeping your roid shield delay long and giving you faster buzz axe throwing speed
 
 BloodTwitch.txt- turns Blood Twitch into a passive skill, but lowers the Swap Speed to compensate
 so at 5/5 Blood Twitch, each bloodlust stack will give you 0.9% swap speed, meaning youll have 90% swap speed with 100 stacks
