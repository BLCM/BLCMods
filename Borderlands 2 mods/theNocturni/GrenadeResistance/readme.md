#Grenade Resistance
  
  -hotfix mods

	some enemies have grenade resistance, which greatly limits the amount of gear that can be used on them.
  
	this removes grenade resistance from enemies
  
	Saturn.txt, Constructor.txt, Jack.txt, and Raidboss.txt removes the grenade resistance of Saturn, Constructors, Jack, and Terra/Vermi/Dragons respectively
	
	All.txt removes it for all of them.
