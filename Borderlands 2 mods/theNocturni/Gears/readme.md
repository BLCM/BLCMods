#Gears

currently contains 2 custom weapons and 2 existing gear change

-existing gear change

	1. Auto-booster.txt
  
	  makes regular boosters and Big Boom Blaster booster auto-pickup, but halves the shield regen to make up for it
  
	  WTF now shoots out two boosters instead of one to compensate for lessened shield regen(you still cant auto-pick up WTF boosters as itd prevent it from shooting out the shock grenades)
	  
	2. LessBlindingFotFH.txt
	
	  lessens the nova effects of FotFH-will most likely affect all Fire Novas unfortunately 
    
    3. Better grenades.txt
  
      my attempts to make some not-so-popular grenades better
        currently improves:
          -Contraband Skyrocket:makes it scale to OP8
          -Breath of Terramorphous:slight singularity effect on initial explosion, doubled the projectiles
          -Nasty Surprise:x2 grenades per drop, child grenades explode as soon as they spawn, increased status effect chance
          -Rolling Thunder:50% increase radius for bounce explosions and bounce explosions will not harm you, while staggering enemies
          -Homing Grenades:x2 homing speed
    

    


-custom weapons

	1. Nidhogg.txt-last updated:5/3(now has a skin)
  
	  Changes the creamer to resemble the BL1 Nidhogg(aka fires a rocket that explodes after a set time, releasing 6 smaller rockets downward)
  
      removes the Moxxi healing as well
      
 
	2. Heimdall.txt-last updated:5/9 (v3.1 makes the skin a bit more olive-ish, no changes other than that so if you like the previous skin better use the v3)
	
      replaces the Evil Smasher, my take at sth that resembles the BL1 Ogre/AjaxOgre(probably closer to AjaxOgre)
	
      accurate, fast firing explosive rifle
