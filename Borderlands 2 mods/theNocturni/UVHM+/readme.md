#Enemy Enhancer (hotfix)

     1.Enemy Enhancer

      -gives enemy better guns as your OP level goes up
       enemies may spawn with blue/purple/etech/even red text(unique/seraph/legendary/pearlescent) guns, and you will rarely see enemies using white or green gear on OP8
  
      -some enemies may spawn with blue/purple/Legendary/some red text(see list below) shields

      -makes some enemies roll faster and stagger for a shorter duration
  
      -doubles Turret/Deathtrap health and makes it unslaggable

     2.Enemy Enhancer Extreme

      -whats in Enemy Enhancer
    
      -every enemy may spawn with blue/purple/Legendary/some Red text shields (Warning: THIS INCLUDES RAID BOSSES)

#Badassify (hotfix)

     1. Badassify
       -increases badass spawn rates by about 100% on TVHM&UVHM(couldnt make it UVHM only)
       
     2. Badassify extreme

#Vendors+

     1. Vendors+

#UVHM+ base (non-hotfix)

    1.UVHM+.txt
      -reduces DoT buff to +150% instead of +250% and increases Maliwan SMG/Pistol DoT to compensate
      -increases badass health and shields by about 50%
      -gives enemy double shield recharge rate(not delay/capacity, just rate)
      -(hopefully) increases enemy accuracy
      -reduces enemy gun damage and DoT damage a bit to compensate for much better guns and more frequent DoTs
      -Improves world drop lootpool so that youd have a better chance for blue/purple/legendary, and less whites

    2.UVHM+(Speed).txt
      -whats in UVHM+.txt
      -increases player movement speed by 20%(multiplicative)
      -increases enemy movement speed by 50% and gives them 10% bullet speed
