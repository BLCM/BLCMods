Some of you may know me from Messiah's videos as the "OP Weapon Guy." While a lot of my guns are a tad OP, I do make a few that make an effort to not be.

Example is my Xiphos, it's powerful, but not OP. On the other hand, my MostOPModInExistence, has its damage set at the Game's Damage Cap (can be increased by Badass Rank and the Bee). (1.07Billion)

I hope you guys enjoy the mods I release.

You may come to find that you like my OP weapons, and I thank you. If you don't like them, don't use them. It's simple.
