Some of you may know me from Messiah's videos as the "OP Weapon Guy." While a lot of my guns are a tad OP, I do make a few that make an effort to not be.

Example is my Xiphos, it's powerful, but not OP. On the other hand, my MostOPModInExistence, has its damage set at the maximum integer recognised by a 32-bit program. (1.07Billion)

I hope you guys enjoy the mods I release, if you'd like to give me ideas directly, join my [Discord](https://discord.gg/3qxrXRY).
If you want to add me on Steam, click this [link](http://steamcommunity.com/id/xxgreemkingxx).

You may come to find that you like my OP weapons, and I thank you. If you don't like them, don't use them. It's simple.

Anyways, have a good day!
