Heyo, it's Greem again.

This folder includes both Pre-Sequel and Borderlands 2 Resources (under appropriate folders) and it consists of literally every resource I've found on this GitHub Repo.

I don't own any of these files and they are owned by Dave and a few others. I just made this folder to make it easier for me to develop mods for the Borderlands games.
It helps me, so I hope it helps you.

See ya! Greem.
