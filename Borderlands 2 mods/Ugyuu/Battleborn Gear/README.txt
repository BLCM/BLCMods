This is a collection of gear representing some Battleborn characters.

This gear is made to replicate the character, it's weapon and the skills that they use, all put into the single gear piece made for them.

Melee characters not included.
ISIC, Miko, Kleese and Kid Ultra are not included, as the skills are very hard to replicate.
Ambra may be included, but will be made in The Pre-Sequel if she does get gear made after her.
