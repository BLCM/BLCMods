# BORDERLANDS 2 / PRE-SEQUEL UI FONT MOD

This file contains the font replacement for the English version of Borderlands 2 / Pre-Sequel. It will replace the original font by a better one, in my opinion. It is easier to read, and doesn't clutter as much.

>>> **This works for The Pre-Sequel as well!** <<<

## NOTES:

The changes to the fonts will revert if you verify the integrity of the game cache through Steam. If this changed back to normal for you, you'll have to do the change again.

## HOW TO INSTALL:

Make sure not to have the game open while doing this. It's not a good idea.

Make a backup of your existing GFxUI.INT before doing this! (It's in Borderlands 2/WillowGame/Localization/INT) Put it somewhere safe.

Open the GFxUI.INT file in this github folder, then click on Raw.

Right click in the raw file that you've just opened and click "Save As.."

**When downloading this from the GitHub, make sure to select "All Files", when saving the file. If you don't do this, it will save as a TXT and the font change won't work at all.**

Copy the new GFxUI.INT to 'Borderlands 2/WillowGame/Localization/INT' and Paste it in that folder. Choose to replace if you get a notification of this file already existing.

Load your game and the font will be changed to the font used in the Japanese version.


Enjoy!
