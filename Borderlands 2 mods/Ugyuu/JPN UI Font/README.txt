This file contains the font replacement for the English version of Borderlands 2 / Pre-Sequel. It will replace the original font by a better one, in my opinion. It is easier to read, and doesn't clutter as much.

>>> This works for The Pre-Sequel as well! <<<

**NOTE:** When gunzerking, the ammo displays incorrectly. The only way i could "fix" this is if I revert the number changes, which would break the compact weapon card numbers as well. 

[HOW TO INSTALL]

Do not have the game running while doing this, or it will crash.

Make a backup of your existing GFxUI.INT before doing this! (It's in Borderlands 2/WillowGame/Localization/INT) Put it somewhere safe.

Open the GFxUI.INT file in this github folder, then click on Raw.

Highlight everything with CTRL + A, then Right click and click "Save As.."

Make sure to change what it saves to, from .txt to "All Files". If you don't do this, it will save as a TXT and the next step won't work.

Copy the new GFxUI.INT to 'Borderlands 2/WillowGame/Localization/INT' and Paste it in that folder. If it notifies you that there already is a file with this name, choose to replace it instead.

Load your game and the font will be changed to the japanese font.


Enjoy!
