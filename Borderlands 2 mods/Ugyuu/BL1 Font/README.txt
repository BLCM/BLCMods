This file contains the Borderlands 1 font replacement for the English version of Borderlands 2 / Pre-Sequel.

>>> Works for The Pre-Sequel! <<<

[Notes]

Damage may be hard to see when switching weapons. Commonly happens at OP8, mostly with rocket launchers.

The changes to the fonts will revert if you verify the integrity of the game cache through Steam. If this changed back to normal for you, you'll have to redownload it.

[HOW TO INSTALL]

Do not have the game running while doing this, or it will crash.

Make a backup of your existing GFxUI.INT before doing this! (It's in Borderlands 2/WillowGame/Localization/INT) Put it somewhere safe.

Open the GFxUI.INT file in this github folder, then click on Raw.

Highlight everything with CTRL + A, then Right click and click "Save As.."

Make sure to change what it saves to, from .txt to "All Files". If you don't do this, it will save as a TXT and the next step won't work.

Copy the new GFxUI.INT to Borderlands 2/WillowGame/Localization/INT and Paste it in that folder. If it notifies you that there already is a file with this name, choose to replace it instead.

Load your game and the font will be changed to the Borderlands 1 font.

Enjoy!
