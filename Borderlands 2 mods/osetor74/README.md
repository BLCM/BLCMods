# Oselands
A big overhaul/rebalance of the game


## Oselands Standalones
A collection of features taken from Oselands and turned into separate standalone features.

While they were designed with the bigger mod in mind, they can be easily detached from it and can simply improve the game on their own.
This is an opportunity for you to pick and choose certain aspects of Oselands that you like without needing to play with the rest.


# BL2:Wonderlands
A rework of character skill trees to make them function more akin to Wonderlands's multiclassing system, while keeping them in-theme with each of the already existing characters
