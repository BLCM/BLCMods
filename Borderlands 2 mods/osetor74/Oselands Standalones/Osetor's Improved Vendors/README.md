# [Osetor's Improved Vendors]
*V. 1.1*

Like the name suggests, this mod is an improvement on the quality of vendors in Borderlands 2. It makes the contents of vendors scale in rarity based on the level of the area you are in, and thus very quickly becomes massively more favorable than vanilla.

Additionally, gives the ability for quest reward unique weapons (and Fight For Sanctuary legendaries) to appear in vendors as well.


### DISCLAIMER

This mod is incompatible with Co-Op. Your game will crash.




## How to install mod

*This section will assume that you haven't installed a BL2 mod before. Feel free to skip steps if you have it set up already*

**If you are completely new to modding**, please watch **[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57WxvASCX70&t=1s)** done by Apple1417 to install the PythonSDK. This is required for both executing the mod in the game to apply its effects, and to make other mods work that Improved Vendors requires to function.

*You may also click [this link](https://bl-sdk.github.io/) for a written guide on how to install the SDK. Also leads to the video guide listed above.*

**You then need to download the following PythonSDK mods if you have not already:**

> **[Command Extensions](https://bl-sdk.github.io/mods/CommandExtensions/)** - Required in creation of new objects that this mod relies on.

This mod **will not work** if you have not properly installed and enabled Command Extensions.

*Credits to Apple1417 for this mod*


**Once you have all this setup, please right click [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/osetor74/BLCMods/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/osetor74/Oselands%20Standalones/Osetor's%20Improved%20Vendors/OsetorVendors.blcm) at the top of this page and save the file as new**


## How to make the mod work

Assuming you have followed the steps in the last section, you then need to execute the mod while in the main menu of the game.

Open your console
*(tilde by default when installing the PythonSDK. If you do not have a key that naturally creates a tilde then you should also install the Hex Multitool to manually set the console key to something else)*

Then type in "exec OsetorVendors.blcm" (assuming you didn't rename the file)

After that, it should show you a notification that it is working.
