# BL2 Lasers

**A mod that recreates the laser weapon category from The Pre-Sequel in BL2 as new SMGs**

**Currently only includes non-uniques. Would like to make uniques as well, but don't know if i will.**

As i can't actually bring the models and such from TPS, i chose SMGs as they shared the most similarities from the existing weapon types (shares all manufacturers and has the closest amount of ammo)



All the stats and functionality are (almost) identical to those in TPS.

*Continuous Damage Bonus is achieved a little differently but in gameplay will feel identical*

### DISCLAIMER

This mod is incompatible with Co-Op. It will make your game crash.




## How to install mod

*This section will assume that you haven't installed a BL2 mod before. Feel free to skip steps if you have it set up already*

**If you are completely new to modding**, please watch **[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57WxvASCX70&t=1s)** done by Apple1417 to install the PythonSDK. This is required for both executing the mod in the game to apply its effects, and to make other mods work that this mod requires to function.

*You may also click [this link](https://bl-sdk.github.io/) for a written guide on how to install the SDK. Also leads to the video guide listed above.*

**You then need to download the following PythonSDK mods if you have not already:**

> **[Command Extensions](https://bl-sdk.github.io/mods/CommandExtensions/)** - Required in creation of new objects such as weapon parts

> **[Sanity Saver](https://bl-sdk.github.io/mods/SanitySaver/)** - Required in saving new weapon parts onto your character

BL2 Lasers **will not work** if you have not properly installed and enabled these 2 mods (mainly command extensions, but still)

*Credits to Apple1417 for these mods*


**Once you have all this setup, please right click [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/osetor74/BLCMods/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/osetor74/BL2%20Lasers/BL2Lasers.blcm) and save the mod file as BL2Lasers.blcm**
