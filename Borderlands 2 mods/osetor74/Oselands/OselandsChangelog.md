## Other Mods Included

	- Most of these mods are QoL mods that i believe make the game more fun/comfortable to play
	- Credits of those that made the mods can be found in the mod file if you open it with BLCMM


	- A large portion of the Unofficial Community Patch
		- Mostly the QoL and bug fix side of the patch, as well as most of the dedicated drop pool changes

	- Loot Midget World
		- Makes Loot Midgets spawn in almost every part of the game, instead of a couple specific ones
		  Has been tweaked a little bit for Oselands

	- No More Orders
		- Removes the need to have Doctor's Orders active to make loot midgets spawn in the Wildlife Exploitation Preserve

	- Better Fast Travel
		- Opens all the one-way Fast Travel stations to work like all the other ones

	- More Chests on Pandora
		- Pretty self explanatory

	- Less Dumb Visuals
		- Reduces and tweaks a lot of particle effects and UI elements to make them clutter the screen less while playing

	- UHD Elemental Sniper Fix (TURNED OFF BY DEFAULT, ENABLE WITH BLCMM)
		- fixes various problems with the UHD patch breaking skins




## Global Changes

	> Stop scaling past 72

		- Added a system where nothing scales their stats past (by default) level 72. If you open the mod file with BLCMM,
		  you can choose betwee level 60, level 72, level 80 and reverting it back to vanilla OP10.

		- an OP7 gun or shield will have the exact same stats as an op0 variant, same with enemy base health and damage.
		  This means that you do not have to refarm items in OP levels at all. The items you get at the set threshold
		  will carry you through every level.



	> Lower Scaling

		- The level scaling multiplier was lowered from 13% per level to 9% per level, which creates much lower numbers
		  Across the game. This shouldn't take away from the experience, instead it should make it so guns last longer
		  while leveling.



	> UVHM Rebalance

		- Enemy health was drastically reduced in UVHM, and slag is way less necessary.
		  The health of enemies in UVHM scales naturally the higher level you are, starting at 50 and capping at 60.
			This should make the entry to UVHM a bit smoother (or 'easier')
		-XP gain is increased after level 60 by 50%
		
		- Passive enemy health regen in UVHM was also removed and they passively take an additional 25% DoT damage.
	
		  (Do note that with the 'nerf' to slag, life steal or any other healing mechanic that relies on
		   a % of damage dealt is just weaker)



	> Element changes

		Elemental damage now follows the following modifiers:

		Non-Elemental(NE)/Explosive/Slag vs all health types: 1x
		Fire/Corrosive vs right health type: 1.2x
		Fire/corrosive vs wrong health type: 0.6x
		Shock vs shield: 1.5x
		Shock vs other health types: 0.95x


		- The duration of all fire/corrosive/shock status effects is now 5 seconds (instead of 5/8/2),
		  and removed shock DoT's inability to stack multiple times on the same enemy
			- This should make it so they are all much more consistent between each other

		- There is no longer any change in elemental damage when moving between playthroughs, and enemy health has
		  been adjusted for elemental damage being so much lower now



	> Player scaling changes

		- Player health (and shield capacity of all shields) is increased by 20%

		- Player skill DoT damage was 'fixed' and is now more heavily used as well.


	> Slower enemy bullets

		- All enemy bullets' speed has been reduced to give you a slighty higher chance of being able to dodge them.
		- This affects rocket enemies the most, making them way more manageable.

		- Multiple options that you can choose from with BLCMM that change how much you want the bullets to be slowed by
			- Options for completely normal speed to -300% speed. Set to -200% by default.


	> Vendor changes

		- Rarities of items in gun and health vendors now become better depending on the level of the area; higher level = better
		- Multiple options that you can choose from with BLCMM that change the cost of ammo and health from vendors
			- Ranges from vanilla values to completely free; set to 25% of original cost by default

		- Purple items in vending machines have a 20% chance to be replaced by a blue/purple unique of the same weapon type



	> Miscellaneous

		- Backpack SDUs now provide +4 to backpack size instead of +3
		- Enemies give 20% more xp, quests give 40% more xp
		- Respec costs no money
		- Legendary rarity color was changed to be a bit darker
		- Vehicles now have 20% more health to compensate for the NE/Explosive/Slag changes
		- You move twice as fast in FFYL compared to vanilla
		
		
		
	> Player Skill Point Limiter
	
		- You now gain your first skill point at level 2 instead of 5

		- You now stop gaining skill points after level 69. This grants you a total of 68 skill points, which is equal
		  to how much you would have had with the old level 72 cap.

			*the reduction in total amount of skill points in theory means more decision making in your build,
			 leading to more possible build diversity. In reality this is still a high amount of skill points,
			 but at the very least it's not limiting.




## Relic Rework

	> Random stats

		- Every non-unique relic in oselands now spawns with an additional randomised "Secondary Stat".
		  This can be anything from fire rate to reload speed to movement speed to elemental resistances to max health to- you get it.
			(the secondary stat can't be the same as the main stat of the relic, so max health on a vitality relic, for example)

		  This makes relics much more interesting and exciting to find, and more impactful from the very start.
		  The goal is that uniques(/ancients) would offer a new opportunity rather than just be better
		  (this is a common theme with me)



	> Uniques

		(A small amount of movement speed = usually 15%)


		Vault Hunter's Relic
			-Now has 15% movement speed instead of the increased blue item chance.
			 This is supposed to just be a nice boost to make the very early game a bit more comfortable,
			 while not being powerful enough so you can throw it away when you find literally anything else


		Afterburner
			-Now comes with 25% movement speed (UCP)

		
		Moxxi's Endowment
			-Spawns with an additional secondary stat alongside its xp buff


		Deputy's Badge
			-Increases mag size for shotguns by a flat +2 after other bonuses, plus some shotgun reload speed

			-A large global fire rate buff (around the same values as vanilla, but not locked to pistols), and additional
			 swap speed


		Otto Idol
			-Retains its health recovery aspect and the curse.
			 However, it is much more powerful (40-50% hp gained on kill at the highest levels) at the cost of a part of your
			 max health

			-Legendary Rarity
			-Has both a reload speed and mag size secondary stat

		
		Loaded Dice (Replacing Lucrative Opportunity)
			-Increases the chance for a world drop legendary by a little bit

			-Unchanged, with exception of lowered numbers to match the changes to vitality relics


		Skin of the Ancients
			-Highest damage reduction boost in the game
			- +20% increased effectiveness of shield damage abilities


		Bone of the Ancients
			-Same as vanilla, but with lowered numbers. However, it is still the only relic in the mod with both
			 elemental damage and cooldown rate, which can be useful.


		Heart of the Ancients (specifically the AR version)
			-FFYL duration and life (vanilla), plus increased critical damage.


		Wings of the Ancients (New)
			- 38-45% movement speed, with a secondary stat


		Shadow of the Seraphs
			-All of your shots with any gun gain +1 projectiles, at the cost of damage, fire rate and accuracy


		Might of the Seraphs
			-A huge amount of melee override cooldown rate, and a small amount of movement speed


		Blood of the Seraphs
			-Increased max health as well as some life steal


		Soul of the Seraphs (Replacing Breath of the Seraphs)

			-Reduces your shield's recharge delay by a flat 1 second, after other buffs

			-Legendary Rarity
			-Increased kill skill duration, movement speed and fire rate
			-No longer has an interaction with the Toothpick


		Shaped Glass (Replacing Hard Carry)
			-Pearlescent Rarity
			-A massive gun damage boost, but halves your health
			-No Longer has an interaction with Easy Mode (Which was reworked)
			
		
		Red Hellion (Replacing Heart of the Ancients - Pistol)
			-Legendary Rarity
			-Slightly increased reload speed
			-Applies 75% of your movement speed bonuses to your gun's fire rate (with a maximum of +100% movement speed)
			
			
		Medusa's Eye (Replacing Heart of the Ancients - Shotgun)
			-Legendary Rarity
			-Slagged enemies are rooted in place instead of slowed
			-Enemies are Blighted, getting their health drained equal to 100% of your maximum health per second


		Backup Magazine (Replacing Heart of the Ancients - SMG)
			-Legendary Rarity
			-Gain a small amount of ammo regen, akin to Salvador's Hoarder class mod
			-Slightly increased mag size
			
			
		Deathless (Replacing Heart of the Ancients - Sniper)
			-Legendary Rarity
			-Massive boost to shield capacity and recharge rate
			-Health is drained while you are above 10% HP


		=== Completely New Relics ===

		Eternal Youth  (Legendary)
			-Reduces your max shield to 10
			-While shield is full, you gain health regeneration equal to your equipped shield's recharge rate
			-Halves life steal effects

			-7.5% chance from Cursed Pirates

   		Pearl of Power  (Seraph)

			-Rolls a primary skill (+3) and a secondary skill (+2).
			 If both rolls give the same skill, it instead gives +4

   			- Skills are chosen from a predetermined list of 6 skills per character:

			Axton: Sentry, Crisis Management, Expertise, Steady, Resourceful, Quick Charge
			Maya: Reaper, Elated, Fleet, Inertia, Blight Phoenix, Discharge
			Salvador: Money Shot, Locked and Loaded, 5 Shots or 6, Yippe-Ki-Yay,
				  I'm The Juggernaut, Just Got Real
			Zer0: Weakness Expl0it, Fast Hands, Tw0 Fang, Fearless, Ambush, Unf0reseen
			Gaige: The Better Half, Unstoppable Force, Strength of 5 Gorillas, Evil Enchantress,
			       Blood-Soaked Shields, Radical
			Krieg: Blood-Filled Guns, Boiling Blood, Feed the Meat, Strip the Flesh, Burn Baby Burn
			       Fire Fiend


			-Guaranteed drop whenever you kill *any* raid in UVHM.


## Weapon Changes


	> Weapon Types/Manufacturers

		- Weapons now list their final crit damage on the item card instead of a % bonus compared to the base 2.0x multiplier

		- I won't list every change like damage or fire rate differences, those can be found in-game. Just try different guns and
		  see how they feel.

			- Rarity changes
				- Mag size and accuracy buffs from rarities has been removed

				- In vanilla, the damage buffs from item rarities stacked with those from parts, which made +damage%
				  parts less effective. This has been changed so that it boosts *base* damage, which means it will be
				  multiplicative with those from weapon parts

				- The rarity damage increase has been changed from 24/48/72% to 15/30/45% for green/blue/purple
					(Guns are more consistently good, damage parts are a tiny bit more effective, and player power in
					general is a bit higher)


			- All base mag sizes for guns have generally been increased to compensate both for the previous change, as well as
			  the changes to matching grip bonuses (listed further down in the weapon parts section).


			- The assault rifle critical damage penalty was removed.


			- All bandit assault rifles, pistols and SMGs have 15% Double shot chance.
			- Removed the aspect from blue+ bandit ARs where they would get a damage and reload penalty in exchange for higher
			  mag


			- Dahl pistols now have a base burst count of 3 while aiming, instead of 2
			- Dahl ARs now have a much shorter delay between bursts
			- Dahl snipers are now semi auto at all times, rather than having a burst while aiming


			- Hyperion guns have 10% increased base critical damage (2.2x instead of 2x)


			- Jakobs guns have 25% increased base critical damage (2.5x instead of 2x)


			- Jakobs and Torgue guns' damage were overall nerfed to compensate for the NE and Explosive damage changes
			  listed under Global Changes > Element Changes


			- Jakobs pistols have a chance to spawn with a Borderlands 1 Revolver style body, lowering their fire rate massively,
			  while increasing base damage, and base critical damage from 2.5x to 3x


			- Jakobs snipers are now always bolt-action, rather than semi auto for blue and purple+


			- Sniper rifle critical damage is calculated differently now, focusing more on base crit rather than increased crit
				- 3x base critical damage, 3.3x for Hyperion(+10%), 3.75x for Jakobs(+25%).

			- Gemstone skins now increase something related to the manufacturer's special effects, intead of being a critical
			  damage bonus for everything. Bandit gets increased double shot chance, Dahl gets increased burst count, etc.


	> Weapon Parts

		- Weapon parts and their manufacturers still keep their identity for the most part. Jakobs are still high damage, low fire
		  rate, tediore is low mag, quick reload, etc.

			- General

				- All vanilla matching bonuses were removed
					- Includes matching grip, matching barrel (a very small amount of damage), and special ones like
					  increased burst for dahl guns on dahl barrels and SMG/Sniper stocks

				- All parts (besides Vladof) now have some kind of small change to either DoT chance or DoT damage.
					- This is to create some small variety with the listed numbers on guns. Maliwan is still the king
					  of DoT.

				- Some stocks have gained small stat buffs to hopefully allow for more diversity. These are supposed to be
				  treated as small bonuses, rather than a main focus. A nice extra.

				- Bandit and Torgue barrels and grips provide +25% Melee Damage.


			- Bandit
				- Barrels now have a mag size buff
				- Stocks now have a small mag size buff
				- Highest DoT chance after Maliwan


			- Dahl
				- Now have a small increase to damage rather than a damage penalty
				- Small increase to both DoT chance and DoT damage


			- Hyperion
				- Now provide critical damage at the cost of damage, and a small amount of bullet speed.
				- Highest DoT damage after maliwan


			- Jakobs
				- Increases damage at the cost of fire rate and mag size (instead of fire rate and reload speed)
				- Has a small DoT chance penalty


			- Maliwan
				- Grip only boosts DoT chance, and barrel only boosts DoT damage. Both are the highest of each category.
				- Now have a very small reload speed buff at the cost of a very small damage nerf

				-Stocks add 1 second to fire/corrosive/shock DoT duration while holding the gun


			- Tediore
				- Grips no longer have a damage penalty
				- Barrels have a sizeable reload speed buff
				- Stocks have a small reload speed buff
				- Has a small DoT damage buff


			- Torgue
				- Grips have a damage buff at the cost of reload speed and accuracy
				- Barrels have a small amount of increased mag size (Does not apply to ARs, since they use unique torgue
				  barrels)
				- Stocks have a small damage buff
				- Has a small DoT damage penalty


			- Vladof
				- Barrels nerfed overall, as they were way ahead of everything else
				- Stocks have a small fire rate buff
				- Has no changes to DoT chance or damage



		- Accessories were more or less normalized across every weapon category (with some exceptions, particularly shotguns and
		  launchers).

			- Accessory_None can't spawn on Blue rarity Unique guns anymore (as well as the Longbow and the Infinity)

			- Bayonets now function similarly to shotguns' "General Boost" accessory, and the original shotgun accessory
			  was replaced with something else. They still retain the +0.5x Melee Damage boost.
			  Bayonets now also passively increase your movement speed by 15% while holding them.

			- Bullet Speed and Accuracy accessories were generally combined into one, and they all have additional fire rate
			  at the cost of a small amount of reload speed (i.e Flying for dahl SMGs or swift for vladof ARs)

			- Stability prefixes now have additional critical damage

			- Assault Rifle Accuracy accessory has been replaced with a double accessory, mimicing the pistol double accessory
				-Includes new prefixes

			- Rocket Launcher Accuracy accessory has been replaced with a ""BFG"" accessory, acting as a stronger variant of the
			  Damage accessory, but doubling the ammo per shot.
				-Includes new prefixes

			- The shotgun vertical grip accessory was heavily nerfed, now providing a +35% increase to pellet count rather than
			  +2, and with a fire rate penalty.

				-(for some guns this can be a buff, mainly high pellet shotguns like a ravager)

				- the accessory, alongside any other part that just wouldn't work on a particular gun (like crit on a
				  splatgun) has been removed from the part lists of that gun

			- SMGs accuracy accessory was replaced with a mag size accessory
				-Includes new prefixes




	> Effects of the changes  (developer notes)

		- The purpose of these changes have been to try to make the guns you find and pick up much more appealing, and  finding a
		  "good gun" is much easier. There will naturally be something better, but the gap in power should be smaller. This also
		  means that you, the player, is just naturally better regardless of what you pick





	> Gun additions / other changes

		- Jakobs and Torgue shotguns now have unique E-Tech barrels, creating the Tracer and Carnage (works like the pearlescent
		  shotgun, with some tweaks, and said pearlescent shotgun was entirely reworked)

		- E-Tech Dart pistols now have high fire rates, and don't consume 2 ammo per shot
		- Torgue pistols now have a unique E-Tech barrel, creating the Carbuncle

		- Snipers' E-Tech barrels are now divided into Splitters and Railguns, Vladof & Dahl / Maliwan & Hyperion respectively.
			-Mimics the laser types from The Pre-Sequel with the same names



	> Shield changes

		- Non-Unique Amp shields were completely reworked
			-No longer have a traditional Recharge Rate, instead recharges to full instantly when the Recharge Delay is over
			-Capacity has been generally lowered to compensate due to this.
			-The damage has been looked over to hpefully make them more appealing to use

			*- These changes were made to hopefully make amp shields a bit more unique compared to everything else,
			   and give you an opportunity to use the amp damage more
			
		- Absorb shields' base absorb chance was increased by 10%

		- Non-Unique Roid shields now provide increased max health. these values are identical to adaptive shields.

		- Non-Unique nova shields now activate when you take damage, regardless of how much shield you have (5 second cooldown)
		  They also gain additional damage equal to 30% of your current max shield capacity

		- Non-Unique Spike shields' damage was tripled

			
		- Shield parts have been completely rebalanced, TL;DR:

			- The shield parts generally keep their identity compared to vanilla, with exceptions

			- Special penalties have been removed, and maliwan's increased special has been slightly lowered.
			  However, it still has the highest +Special

			- Dahl parts now serve as a general-use part, giving a nice boost to the main 3 stats while not affecting special
			  in any way

			- Vladof parts now give a passive 10% movement speed each

			- Maliwan capacitors were reworked to not share stats with other maliwan parts,
			  so the main focus of those parts are the elemental immunities.




			> [E-Tech Shields]

				- This mod introduces new shields under the E-Tech rarity.
				  The whole gimmick with all of these is that, much like Rough Rider, they have 0 shield capacity but grant
				  other bonuses instead, either to compensate for that lack of shield, or just giving the risk of
				  sacrificing survivability to gain something else instead

				  Each E-Tech shield type has a 5% chance of dropping from a particular badass enemy type in the game, listed
				  below:

				- Berserker shield (Bandit) - Badass Psychos
					-Dealing or taking damage causes you enter a rage, gaining movement speed and life steal while your
					health drains very quickly.

				- Titan Heart Shield (Hyperion) - Badass Loaders
					-Grants increased max health, and adds 10% of your maximum health value as amp damage to all your
					 shots

				- Shatter Tank Shield (Pangolin) - Spiderant Kings/Queens (/their renamed versions in higher difficulties)
					-Reduces max health on top of the 0 capacity, but grants flat health regen

     				- Chromatic Hydra Shield (Anshin) - Elemental Badass Skags
					-High adaptive shield effect value
     					-*Overrides* elemental damage multipliers when dealing damage against enemies with its own
	  				 multiplier, negating the downsides of the elemental damage types but also the upsides in
					 exchange for a good general multiplier.



## Drop Changes

	> Rarity odds

		- TL;DR  white less common, purple and legendary more common

		- VeryCommon weight lowered from 200 to 100
		- Common weight lowered from 100 to 60
			
			- Both of the above get reduced down to half of their values between levels 30 and 80

		- Legendary weight increased from 0.01 to 0.0667. This gets increased by 20% for each OP level,
		  up to a tripled value (~0.2)

		- VeryRare weight increased from 0.1 to 0.25


		- Legendary weight is doubled in the following areas:
			Digistruct Peak
			the 3 Circles of Slaughter
			Leviathan's Lair
			Torgue's Arena (the big one in his DLC)


	> Dedicated legendary drop changes

		- Most UCP dedicated pool changes have been ported over to Oselands

		- Head and skin drops have been removed from dedicated legendary pools entirely

		- Any dedicated pool with more than 1 item in the pool has had its chance multiplied by the amount of items in the pool,
		  meaning that any individual item in the pool generally has a 10% chance of dropping, rather than having
		  10% split between all of them

		- Legendary shield pools not world dropping properly has been fixed
		- The 6 "new" legendary relics added in the mod are now part of the world drop pool


	> Torgue Vendor Conversion to Legendary Vendors

		- Torgue Vendors have been changed to now include a massive selection of legendaries every time you load the map it is in.
		  These legendaries are not locked to just torgue items, as they now basically serve the function of a legendary vendor.
			
		- Torgue Tokens now drop everywhere in the game as random drops from enemies, so you end up accumulating them over time.
			Torgue DLC activities still award you with tokens as well, so there is still a reason to farm them specifically.
			
		- Different vendors in the DLC are given different item pools, so it is easier to get the item you want out of them.
			The item types are spread as follows:
			
			Arena 		- shotgun, launcher
			Moxxi's Bar 	- SMG, pistol
			Beatdown 	- AR, sniper
			Pyro Pete's Bar - COM, relic
			Forge 		- grenade, shield
			Southern Raceway- random
			Badass Crater 	- random
			
			(the vendors for the latter 2 are in an awkward spot compared to the rest, so they aren't really worth it to farm)


	> Raid Boss Legendary Drops

		- Legendary world drop weight is multiplied by 3 in Terramorphous's Peak and the Winged Storm (dragons of destruction map)

		- Hyperius, Master Gee, Pyro Pete and Voracidous now all have 4 individual pools with 6.67% drop chance each every kill which
		  drop a random world drop item from the legendary pool of guns, shields, grenades and class mods respectively.
			This chance increases by 20% for each OP level, up to a tripled value

		- Voracidous now has a 25% chance to drop a random Gen2 Legendary Class Mod

		- Dexiduous now drops 5 guaranteed legendaries every time you kill it, and an additional 5 chances of ~13% each that scale
		  with OP levels


	> Knuckledragger

		- Now drops a random white rarity pistol instead of always dropping a jakobs pistol

		- The chest after knuckledragger now gives a random white rarity shotgun, in addition to a random white rarity AR, SMG or
		  sniper



	> Golden Chest

		- Made it cost 20 Eridium, instead of golden keys

		- Now throws out 3 items in front of it, instead of spawning items within the chest itself
			- This also had the side effect of bypassing the need of watching the entire chest opening/closing animation to
			  re-open it

		- Now also gives you gemstone guns, legendaries, and blue-rarity class mods (since they are actually good).



	> Tubbies

		- Gen1 Pearlescent guns have been removed from the Tubby pearlescent pool, and the base chances have been increased
		- The tubby pearlescent pool now also scales with Overpowered levels again:

			OP Level
			0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9     10
			10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 21, 25, 27.5, 30

		- This makes it so it's way less unforgiving. Also means that OP levels are more appealing, especially higher ones,
		  and makes 9 and 10 a smaller optional bonus.


		- Tubbies now have a 20% chance to drop an additional world drop legendary, similar to loot midgets' 15%


	> Witch Doctors

		- Now have a ~3.3% chance to drop a world drop legendary. This is doubled for badasses
		- Scales with OP levels, up to a tripled chance

	> Omnd-Omnd-Ohk

		- Now has a 3% chance to spawn instead of 1% (tweaked UCP)
		- Twister is now a guaranteed drop


	> Uranus / Cassius

		- The overall chance to drop legendaries was heavily reduced, though it still exists in a small capacity to keep an essence
		  of vanilla


	> Jimmy Jenkins / Loot Goon Goliaths / Muscles

		- All 3 of these enemies now have gotten additional legendary drop chances seperate from world drop chances,
		  on top of UCP making jimmy jenkins function like a normal loot midget


	> Haderax Chests

		- The chances for legendaries have been toned down to match the other raid bosses in the mod
		- The previously digi peak set items now have a 10% chance of spawning in their respective chests
			- Now basically acting as dedicated drops, and 'honors' their pearlescent rarity a little better

		- Now provide a somewhat even spread of the different types of items


	> Mimics

		- Now have a ~5% chance of dropping a world drop legendary. Scales with OP levels, up to a tripled chance
		- 66% chance of dropping a random Dragon Keep class mod



## Enemy Changes

	> Raid Bosses

		> All raid boss health (except dexi) has been reduced. Some of them by *very* substantial amounts.
			- Partially due to the nerfs to the Bee shield. But also to hopefully make it way more flexible to use different
			  kinds of items.

			- Voracidous's shield is lowered, but only in UVHM. I have not figured out how to lower it in the other 2
			  difficulties yet.

			(While not a raid boss, these changes also applies to Badassasaurus Rex because fuck that enemy lmao)

		> Master Gee

			- Now has a 98% resistance in his initial phase instead of a complete immunity
			- Absorbing an acid puddle reduces resistance by 20%, applies to both Gee and yourself

			- These changes should make it so you have way more flexibility in how you approach the fight by giving
			   you the ability to deal damage as well, while keeping the gameplay of trying to lure him to the acid puddles


		> Proof of a Hero

			- All raid bosses now have a 1% chance of dropping a new "Proof of a Hero" relic.
			  It only exists as a trophy, as it lists which raid boss you got it from in its description.


	> Southpaw Steam & Power

		- The following enemy types can now spawn anywhere in Southpaw
			shielded nomads
			shock nomads
			heavy nomads

		- Badass psychos and nomads are more common

		- Changed some enemies to be considered armored instead of flesh:
			Standard and Badass psychos
			Standard and shielded nomads (excluding badass)
			Assassin Oney
			Assassin Reeth

		- Increased the health of the following enemies:
			Standard psychos

## Vault Hunters

	> Overview
		- Overall, characters are just better in every single way, both damage and survivability. With some exceptions.
		- An overarching goal has been to give more opportunities to give said damage and survivability, spreading the sources for
		  each around

		- Every character has a 'passive bonus' for each of the 3 branches in their skill trees;
			Every time a skill reaches 5 points, you gain some buff that is shared across every skill in that branch
			This effect stacks for each skill you get to 5 points

			Works if class mods boost skills to 5/5 or higher

			Certain skills with a specific pre-requisite need to do that pre-requisite to get the passive effect as well.
				This includes every kill skill as well as things like Battlefront and Wreck.
				However, there also isn't any specific pattern to it.

## Unique Items

	> Now, this will not be a full list of all the changes to every unique item. That would be a really long list, and
	  i still want to keep some semblance of discovery. This part is here more for what you can expect. Some examples.


	  Every unique gun has been looked over in some way. Some guns did not change at all, or in very small ways. Some guns were
	  nerfed/buffed, some guns were readjusted to be closer to what they were in vanilla after indirect changes like through
	  weapon types. A lot of guns were given a new identity,  such as the Patriot now being a very slow, but high damage and
	  high-mag vladof sniper. Some guns were replaced, which is more detailed in the next part.

	  The power of each gun was, of course, looked over, and hopefully more things are more powerful than what they used to be.
	  Try things out, use things you wouldn't otherwise. I especially recommend trying the items that are basically memes in vanilla.


	  A lot of unique guns were given a new visual barrel to hopefully give some variety in the look of uniques within a weapon type.
	  To give that feeling of "oh, this is different."


	  Also, yes, the Grog is nerfed.
	  
	
	> Replaced unique guns
	
		As stated before, there are some items that were completely replaced to allow them to be much cooler than they previously
		were. None of the drop locations of any of the items listed here have been moved from where the original item drops in
		vanilla.

		> Hammer (Dog)
			-Exceptionally high fire rate and shoots explosive gyrojets that have added grenade splash damage
		
		> Spy (Commerce)
			-High crit damage hyperion SMG (basically like a smaller version of the Bitch)
		
		> Destroyer (Seraphim)
			-Aiming down sights causes the gun to fire a continuous burst until its mag is empty
			-Good base damage, slightly increased crit damage, lower mag.
		
		> Eraser (Carnage)
			-Shoots 5 gyrojets in a straight line with varying speeds, much higher base damage
