# [Oselands]
*V. 1.2.6*

**Oselands** is a re-balance/overhaul of Borderlands 2 with the single goal of making the experience from start to finish more fun through polishing the gameplay experience and trying to make as many good options as possible. Obviously fun is subjective, but I've tried to cover as many bases as possible.

The following links are meant solely for if you are within the ModCabinet page for the mod:

> **[Main Page](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/osetor74/Oselands)** - Full summary of the mod and **instructions on how to install it**. If you are already there, this link is useless.

> **[Full Changelog](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/blob/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/osetor74/Oselands/OselandsChangelog.md)**

> **[Version Notes](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/blob/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/osetor74/Oselands/OselandsVersionNotes.md)** - Changes separated by the version they came in

**If you are already on the main page, scroll down for a slightly more detailed summary of the mod**


### DISCLAIMER

If you are going to play with this mod and start at level 1, you need to make the character and get to the first fast travel point *before* you turn the mod on. If you enter the character select screen with Oselands turned on, your game will crash.

Also, the mod is incompatible with Co-Op. That also makes the game crash.







## [ How to install mod ]

### --- Installing the PythonSDK ---

**If you are completely new to modding**, please watch **[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57WxvASCX70&t=1s)** done by Apple1417 to install the PythonSDK. This is required for both executing the mod in the game to apply its effects, and to make other mods work that Oselands requires to function.

*You may also click [this link](https://bl-sdk.github.io/) for a written guide on how to install the SDK. Also leads to the video guide listed above.*


---

### --- Installing required PythonSDK mods ---

**You then need to download the following PythonSDK mods if you have not already:**

> **[Command Extensions](https://bl-sdk.github.io/mods/CommandExtensions/)** - Required in creation of new objects such as weapon parts

> **[Sanity Saver](https://bl-sdk.github.io/mods/SanitySaver/)** - Required in saving new weapon parts onto your character

Oselands **will not work** if you have not properly installed and enabled these 2 mods (mainly command extensions, but still)

*Credits to Apple1417 for these mods*

### --- Saving the mod file ---
**Once you have set up all of the above, please right click [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BLCM/BLCMods/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/osetor74/Oselands/Oselands.blcm) and save the mod file as Oselands.blcm**

## How to make the mod work

Assuming you have followed the steps in the last section, you then need to execute the mod while in the main menu of the game.

Open your console
*(tilde by default when installing the PythonSDK. If you do not have a key that naturally creates a tilde then you should also install the Hex Multitool to manually set the console key to somethting else)*

Then type in "exec Oselands.blcm" (assuming you didn't rename the file)

After that, it should show you a notification that it is working.

## [ Mod Content ]


   - **A re-balance of guns**, both the base weapon types and a look at every unique gun, with the goal of making some individual items more unique compared to everything else. A few unique items have been replaced with new ones, a lot of them are redefined with new unique stats, and there's even a number of totally new legendary guns that don't replace anything. Try out items or weapon part combinations you would never use otherwise.


   - **Refined/reworked character skill trees**. Not shying away from adding new stuff to characters, but also trying to keep the overall idea of the character the same wherever possible; more ways to build the same character is in 100% of situations a good thing. All of this also extends to every class mod.

*Gaige and Maya are the most changed ones, and i am the most proud of Maya. So that is what i would personally recommend playing the mod with if you're starting a new character. If you dislike Gaige then that is another thing you could try out and see if you like it more than vanilla.*


   - **Basically a re-balance to the entire difficulty of the game from start to finish**. Elements and their damage multipliers (including non-elemental) are rebalanced, slag and UVHM are reworked. Player survivability stats are adjusted to compensate for those elemental changes.


   - **A rework of relics** as a whole to make them a much more interesting item category


   - **Better item drops** that become even better the higher level you are. World drop legendary items are much more common,
     but not to the point of drowning you in them. A lot of stuff that were level-locked early on can generally drop right from the start now.
     The mod also adds and buffs a bunch of alternative drop sources (including raid bosses) to give you more options in which content you want to do to get items.

*You're expected to get items (and specifically good versions of those items) much easier than in vanilla. I would rather get you to play with all the toys faster, instead of you needing to grind for hours and hours.*

A lot of this mod has been made with the mindset of "If it's cool or fun, it'll go in." so a lot of specific things can be unexpected. I will honor how something was done in vanilla, but if there is a more fun alternative, i will probably end up doing that instead. If something looks odd, just assume it's intentional.



I also have to say, this mod is like a pseudo-modpack; I've taken mods and integrated them as part of this mod, all of these being mods that i believe just make the game more comfortable to play.
Mods included:

  - A large part of the UCP (not all of it)
  - No More Orders / No Space Cowboy - Makes it so certain guaranteed loot midgets spawns work without needing the Doctor's Orders and Space Cowboy side quests respectively
  - Fast Travels 2 - Turns every one-way fast travel to work both ways
  - More Chests on Pandora - Pretty self explanatory
  - Loot Midget World - Makes loot midgets be able to spawn basically anywhere
  - Catapult First - smaller mod that simply makes it so the bandit technical will always be set to the barrel catapult.

*It goes without saying that all credits goes to each of the creators of these mods. I do not own any of it.*
