This should help with some issues.

[1] "My game crashes when i execute your mod and start new game \ other stuff" 
 Solution 1: Check your file for copy-paste errors
 Solution 2: Execute it as a separate file. Do NOT merge it with your patch.
 
[2] "My game crashes in crowded areas"
 Solution 1: Let me know about it. Tell me location name and other important info. [For me it works fine, CTD's are rare]
 Solution 2: Just run this area again.
 Solution 3: Lower your game setting a bit. Maybe you have a weak PC and game can't handle amount of enemies.
 
[3] "Game is too hard"
 Solution 1: Farm some good gear, gain some additional lvls, complete some side-quests.
 Solution 2: Check Vendors, buy good gear.
 Solution 3: Find more hidden chests.
 Solution 4: Play Co-op.
 
[4] "I gain Spark Keys error in main-menu"
 Solution 1: Wait around 10 seconds, execute my mod again.
 Solution 2: You have to play online \ be connected to the Steam.
 
[5] "Chubbies are too fat"
 Solution 1: Ignore them [<49 lvl]
 Solution 2: Jump around and try to kill it.
 
[6] "I can't defeat 'BossName'"
 Solution 1: Play Co-op.
 Solution 2: Get better gear, complete some side-quests to gain lvl.
 
[7] "I cannot move after respawning"
 Solution: Just exit to main menu and continue playing again.
 
[8] "I don't have any skills changed"
 Solution: You probably downloaded not entire mod. My mod is a huge wall of text,so give github around 20-30 seconds to load it properly.
