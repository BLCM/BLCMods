HARDER BETTER FASTER (SCOOTER)
By Elbow Removal Service
CURRENT VERSION: 0.9.4


This is a modpack based upon BL2Reborn. This only contains mods that are present and accessible already. There is very minimal unique content contained here, mostly consisting of my own edits to some of the skills (Such as Zer0's Headsh0t, which was changed from +4% Critical Hit Damage to +8% Critical Hit Damage).

This modpack changes most facets of the game. Skills, Items, Loot and Drops, Enemies, Quests, the World, and Quality of Life are changed/improved. There are very few new items in this modpack, all of which are replacements. The primary focus of this pack is QoL and the Vault Hunters (Skills and Class Mods). 

Obviously, this mod is not to be run with BL2Reborn, UCP, Blassic, Borderlands 2.5, Exodus, FFYLands, or any other large
overhaul. 

NOTE 1: I'm not a coder by any means. I'm just an idiot with BLCMM and rudimentary capabilities.
NOTE 1 1/2: I can however still code some things to some extent. Slightly. 
NOTE 2: I usually have the pack set to offline mode. If you run mods online, you'll need to change that. 
NOTE 2 1/2: Sometimes it is online. 
NOTE 2 3/4: Sorry.
