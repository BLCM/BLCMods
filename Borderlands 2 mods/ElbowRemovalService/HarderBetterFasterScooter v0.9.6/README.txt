HARDER BETTER FASTER (SCOOTER)
By Elbow Removal Service
CURRENT VERSION: 0.9.8

This modpack is based off of BL2Reborn and UCP, along with several other mods. All credit goes to the creators/writers of the mods/code. 

This is a modpack based upon BL2Reborn. This only contains mods that are present and accessible already. There is very minimal unique content contained here, mostly consisting of my own edits to some of the skills (Such as Zer0's Headsh0t, which was changed from +4% Critical Hit Damage to +8% Critical Hit Damage).
This mod intends to gear towards balancing gameplay better at the higher levels. The primary way of accomplishing this is skill rebalancin, although just about everything is affected. 

All facets of the game are changed. Skills, Items, Loot and Drops, Enemies, Quests, the World, and Quality of Life are changed/improved. There are very few new items in this modpack, all of which are replacements. The primary focus of this pack is QoL and the Vault Hunters (Skills and Class Mods). 

Most skills are rebalanced, sometimes severely. Instead of (in general) moving all skills towards the Average or Above Average ranges, skills instead tend towards the Overpowered tiers because of the difficulty of the Overpowered levels. The gear and enemies are overpowered. This just evens the playing field. 

Obviously, this mod is not to be run with BL2Reborn, UCP, Blassic, Oselands, Borderlands 2.5, Exodus, FFYLands, Vanilla Plus, or any other large overhaul. 

All locked categories are dependencies for other code.
