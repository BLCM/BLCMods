Enemy Bullets
==============

This mod aims to make the game more like a bullet hell by slowing down the speed of enemy bullets. All guns used by enemies (including launcher enemies!) will have slower projectile speed than any of the player used counterparts. Weighting for rarities has been slightly adjusted, so legendary and purple guns will be a lot more common - but easier to dodge. There are *6* options of speed to choose from, with a lowest of 50% and a highest of 300% decrease in bullet speed. The default is set to 200%. This mod *does require command extensions to be used, so make sure you have installed first here*:https://bl-sdk.github.io/mods/CommandExtensions/. 

TVHM Scaling Fix for Headhunters and Fight For Sanctuary
========================================================

Fight For Sanctuary and Headhunters will now properly scale as all other TVHM main story DLCs, meaning that it will be at the player level upon entering the DLC for the first time, and will scale to level 50 after killing Warrior.
For example, if the player enters Fight For Sanctuary at level 46, the enemies will be at level 46, instead of staying at 38. It will then scale to level 50 after TVHM Warrior is defeated.
