BL2 Mega TimeSaver XL
=====================

This mod speeds up nearly all the noticeably-slow interactive objects
that you use throughout BL2 by 5x (in general), most notably:

 * Containers
 * Doors / Gates
 * Drawbridges
 * Fast Travel Stations *(primarily for Three Horns Valley, Highlands, and Hunter's Grotto)*
 * Lifts / Elevators / Transporters
 * Slot Machines
 * Vehicle Aimations

This mod obsoletes two of my previous mods: *BL2 Container TimeSaver XL*
and *BL2 Fast Travel TimeSaver XL*.  Except for one tweak to the digistruct
peak loot chests (so they digistruct in more quickly), the container and
fast travel sections are identical to those old mods, so it won't actually
*hurt* anything to have both installed, but you may as well delete the old
ones anyway.

The mod is *primarily* focused on the things you directly interact with,
so there's a number of things which are generally **not** sped up, such
as: NPCs performing actions or moving around (some exceptions being the
doors Claptrap opens in Windshear Waste, etc); sequences like a gate
opening to spawn a new enemy (such as the assassins in Southpaw Steam
and Power); dialogue; or anything relating to cutscenes.  (If you want
faster cutscenes, just use FromDarkHell's Cutscene Remover to skip them
entirely.)

Note that there are a few things especially affected by this:

 * The vault symbol on the underside of the elevator in Ore Chasm
   is pretty much un-gettable now.
 * **Capture the Flags**: The flags now ascend at a reasonable pace.
   I'm pretty sure that enemy spawns get missed because of this,
   so technically we're nerfing this mission.
 * **The Hunger Pangs** (Wattle Gobbler Headhunter DLC): The
   cooking time has been shortened by a bit, which means that
   the mission's nerfed a bit.
 * **Let There Be Light** (Captain Scarlett DLC): The elevator
   you have to wait for before ascending to the lighthouse level
   has been speeded up quite a bit, which obviously makes that
   mini-arena easier.

This mod contains a section kindly donated by Gronp, specifically:
[Faster Vehicle Animations](https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlands2/mods/175).
Many thanks for this!  The original mod has options to choose how much
speedup the vehicle animations receive, so if you want a faster option for
those, import Gronp's mod and make sure that it's after this mod in your
mod list.

Some other notable things sped up by this mod (this is not an exhaustive
list):

 * The minecart in Caustic Caverns
 * The mortar aiming sequence in Highlands
 * The shield grinder in the Highlands
 * Laser cutting times during the mission **Statuesque**
 * Hammerlock's walking speed during the Big Game Hunt DLC opening sequence
 * The Rubik's Cube puzzle in Mines of Avarice
 * The mining drill during the mission **Claptocurrency**
 * The cooking process in Gluttony Gulch
 * Thresher fishing, in Rotgut Distillery
 * Ed's movement speed, in Rotgut Distillery (also removed his proximity
   requirement)

Things NOT Sped Up
------------------

There are a few mission-related things which could probably
be sped up a bit but didn't seem worth the effort:

 * Some timings in The Pretty Good Train Robbery
 * The power core / Sanctuary attack sequence in Rising Action
 * Main arena doors in Fink's Slaughterhouse
 * The drawbridge in Highlands Outwash.  It already feels fast
   enough, and it's not like you usually interact with it anyway.
 * Claptrap's Birthday Bash - the longish wait sort of seems like
   the point.
 * Might be nice to boost Mick Zaford's walking speed, in the
   second Clan War quest
 * The racecars in that second Clan War quest are kind of slow,
   too, though we wouldn't want to make them too hard to destroy.
 * Similarly, Bagman is slow.
 * The little train car in 3:10 To Kaboom could be faster, but
   I didn't want to speed it up since you technically have to
   zip over to the other side to stop it.
 * Various elements of Bloodwing's fight could be speeded up
 * Terramorphous's spawning sequence could be speeded up
 * Brick could move faster when going to open the door, prior to
   moonshot attack.
 * Hacked Overseer movement speed could probably be sped up.
   (Its laser-cutting phase *is* speeded up, though.)  My initial
   attempts at doing so didn't work, though.
 * Fight in Control Core Angel can drag a bit if you're quick
 * Might be nice to speed up the crate pickups in Toil and Trouble
   (from Brick's Buzzards)
 * The initial delay when getting the vault key location info from
   the terminal in Arid Nexus Badlands could be shorter.
 * The gate leading to Hero's Pass could use a bit more speeding-up,
   but I'm through with it for now.
 * Basically all the Headhunter packs have elements which could be
   sped up more than they currently are, especially during the story
   missions, though a lot of it is rather dialogue-dependent.  I'm
   happy enough with how they are right now, though.
 * Specifically, note that when entering the Wattle Gobbler arena
   during the main quest, you'll be stuck inside the forcefield for
   awhile.  Farming the Wattle Gobbler post-mission should be nice
   and quick, though.
 * The treasure room gate at the end of the Captain Scarlett DLC
   was left as-is, since it opens fast enough already.
 * I couldn't find where to speed up Hammerlock repairing the
   Fan Boat station, at the beginning of the Hammerlock DLC.
 * The beard-creation process in The Beard Makes The Man could be
   faster, but why rush such majesty?
 * The doors to Hatred's Shadow weren't sped up; you can't
   really get to them in time for it to matter anyway.
 * Ancient Dragon summoning sequence remains unchanged.
 * Venting the gas in Mt. Scarab Research Center could be sped up,
   but didn't seem worth it as you're usually waiting for dialog
   anyway.
 * Actually various parts of the Mt. Scarab plot interactions could
   probably be sped up, but you're generally dialogue-locked for
   those anyway, and they don't tend to reoccur when visiting post-
   plot, so it hardly seems worth it.
 * Most of the doors in Digistruct Peak weren't touched, since they
   didn't really need anything.

Bugs
====

This mod causes a couple of weird behaviors, though nothing terrible:

 * The barge door at the end of Windshear Waste will open all the way,
   before the dialogue where Angel hacks it open.  Doesn't break
   the quest, though.
 * Some maps (the Fridge being one example) have basically all their doors
   sped up, because I didn't care to figure out which ones were
   player-blockers and which ones just spawned enemies.  This can
   cause enemy spawns to look a bit weird, because the doors are
   sometimes already closing or closed before the enemy actually
   shows up.
 * The tram system in Highlands Outwash is a little janky in spots,
   but I didn't care enough to track it down.  The lifting/dropping
   of crates looks a bit too fast, and the tram which carries crates
   from the Thresher arena to the main area of the map speeds up too
   much once it gets to the main area side.
 * The minecart from Minecart Mischief is a bit weird when sped up,
   though really that's just the inherent jankiness becoming more
   noticeable.  Theoretically those curves could be smoothed out,
   but it's not worth the effort.
 * The door that opens to let in the Badass Loader in Wildlife
   Exploitation Preserve (and lets you proceed further in the
   level) is a bit off-kilter; will open up and then sort of stutter
   back closed-and-open again.
 * When farming the Wattle Gobbler (as in: not in the main Gluttony
   Gulch mission), the tributes which spawn are a bit slow to do so.
 * The first crumpet in Lair of Infinite Agony is actually a little
   harder than usual to get, since the elevator goes way too fast
   to get it that way.  You'll have to jump down from the top and
   get it that way, which still requires more timing than it used
   to.
 * The drawbridge in Dahl Abandon glitched out for me once, where
   the near side stayed visibly up even though it should've been
   down.  Hitting the button again reset it back to how it should
   be, though, so I guess just hit the button again if that
   happens to you.

Mod Construction / Implementation Details
=========================================

*(This section is only relevant for someone looking to edit the mod in the
same way I do, or just someone curious about my mod construction techniques.
If you're just looking to run the mod, see the "Usage" section above.  The
mod can, of course, be edited directly in BLCMM as well, once it's
been imported.)*

This mod is generated using a Python script named `generate-mod.py`,
which makes use of some data classes from my [FT/BLCMM Explorer](https://github.com/apocalyptech/ft-explorer)
project.  You'll need to copy (or symlink, if you're on Linux or OSX) that
project's `resources` and `ftexplorer` dirs into this one, to run the
generation script.  The script also makes use of `modprocessor.py` from the
parent directory, so copy (or symlink) that as well.
