LootDespawner.loot
------------------
This mod is farily simple, it just changes the amount of time it takes for all loot to shrink and despawn from the game.
This can prevent crashes upon traveling, non-functioning inventories, excessive lag, etcetera.
Does not conflict with mods that change item rarity colors (should be loaded last in Filter Tool to prevent despawn time overrides).
Does not delete any quest items, so it should be safe for any playthrough (please let me know if it does).
Various options for times, I'd personally use Recommended for standard gameplay.
If using mods such as Loot Splosion, Cold Dead Hands, or anything that causes excessive loot, I'd use the 1 minute despawn time.
