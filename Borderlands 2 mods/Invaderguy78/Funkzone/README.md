# Funkzone 1.7
## This is Funkzone, a mod made by me which you might also know me by Funkotron9000. 

This is a silly rebalancing and overhaul mod made to really just make the game a mess. In its current state, Funkzone is a fast paced power trip meant to make the game feel like if you took Cruelty Squad and glued it to BL3! 
# THIS MOD REQUIRES COMMAND EXTENSIONS, AND SANITY SAVER.

I have added numerous pieces of new gear for you to mess with and touched up on many of the skill trees! Skill trees are somewhat vanilla but have some extra powerful effects.

### Compatability: 
This mod is not compatible with other text based overhauls, and I would advise against using it with BL2Fix, or mobs that boost drop rates or XP rates, these are things I already touched up on. 
### Installation: 
This is simply a .blcm mod, so it goes in Binaries like other .txt mods.
### Important Gameplay Info:
I have labled different damage modifiers using very specific language in skill trees. You can get an idea of how your damage formula works based on stuff like "global damage", "enemies take", "base damage", and what specific modifiers are involved in your boosts.
