# List of changes
All Vladof items (excluding class mods and some unique/seraph items) have been reskinned and renamed. This includes gemstone skins (now Orichalcum) and prefixes. Names are based off of Greek weapons and prefixes are based off of "superiority" as well as a few BL1 prefixes (List of Prefixes and Titles can be found below).

Atlas Weapons have been globally rebalanced. The stats should be above average in all aspects.

Most special weapons have been replaced or adjusted. Details down below.

Atlas weapons have the feature of increasing action skill cooldown while held.

# Reticle
If you're having issues with reticles disappearing, it is a known issue. Due to gearbox wizardry, depending on the grip of a weapon, and the barrel of said weapon, the scoped view will have missing parts when using the Atlas logo. Find this line in the file:
`GD_Manufacturers.Manufacturers.Vladof FlashLabelName Atlas`
and disable it or use FilterTool.
