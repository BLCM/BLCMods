_**Note:** As for my Double Quest Reward "Redux", this Mod will give you the choice between 2 weapons/items instead of a single one, so it will double the chance to get a weapon/item with desired parts._	

### Changelog:

v1.0.0, September 2, 2018
 - Initial public release
 
v1.0.1, September 5, 2018
- Added Stalker of Stalkers in The Highlands... Ooops! I totally forget this mission... perhaps because the "Turn In" is done in a letter box in Overlook!

v1.0.2, October 15, 2018
- Added Jakobs Weapon reward for Grendel in Hayter's Folly (DLC Captain Scarlett and Her Pirate's Booty)

### Compatibility:

- 100% compatible with UCP 4.1
- Should be compatible with most other mods, as long as they do not touch the Quest Reward.
- This mod was tested -and work nicely!- with:
  - [UCP Patch](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Community%20Patch%20Team)   
  - [Better Quest](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/blob/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Hemaxhu/Quest%20Rewards/Better%20Quests) by [Hemaxu](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Hemaxhu) .

To be sure to get this mod working correctly (as intended), don't forget to place it **AFTER** UCP 4.1 and Better Quest. 

### To do:

- [x] Check twice if I don't forget a Hammerlock mission somewhere (again).
- [x] Clean the code and remove all my ~~shitty~~ notes.
- [ ] Make (again) a new playthrough to be sure that all the rewards are given correctly.
