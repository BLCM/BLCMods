This Read Me is just here as a quick synopsis, for detailed informations, each Mod has is own Read Me (and even a Changelog), so don't hesitate -whoosh!- to give a look on it.

## Moxxi Skin Packs: 

- __Moxxi Signature Classic Collection:__ Based on *Creamer/Heart Breaker* vanilla skin, now the Moxxi weapons skins are uniformized to look like an actual manufacturer.

- __Moxxi Signature Elegance Collection:__ The red similar to the little _Cartier_ box, with golden part inserted into (silver) brushed steel, this is the French elegance. 

- __Moxxi Signature Pinky Collection:__ Based on *Slow Hand/Good Touch* vanilla skin, now the Moxxi weapons skins are uniformized to look like an actual manufacturer.
