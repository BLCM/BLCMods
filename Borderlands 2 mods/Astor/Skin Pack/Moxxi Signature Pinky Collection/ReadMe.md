## Moxxi Signature Pinky Collection

Recently, when a friend showed me his latest acquisitions for his Hot Wheels collection, I noticed the *Corvette Stingray (Barbie) Pink 2018*: all Pink & White!

That make me think immediately that girls can be very serious about colors... at least regarding the pink color... and I won't be surprised that some of them really like the Moxxi weapons with a pink skin, but unfortunately, there is only fews available.

So, I decided to adapt the Moxxi Signature Pink Skin slighty...

I keep the vanilla pink color, colorize the metal part in white, adapt the Moxxi logo in a more appropriate size when necessary... and repeat the same work on all the Moxxi weapons.

And now, like a Barbie girl in a Barbie world; you can feel the glamour in pink with the *Moxxi Signature Pinky Collection*.
