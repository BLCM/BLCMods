## Dr Zed E-Tech Geek

### What do this mod?

- The 7 missions given by Dr Zed in the main game will be rewarded with a E-Tech weapon/item:
  - Arms Dealing (The Highlands)
  - Medical Mystery (Three Horns - Valley)
  - Medical Mystery: X-Com-municate (Three Horns - Valley)
  - Monster Mash: Part 1 (The Dust)
  - Monster Mash: Part 2 (Arid Nexus - Boneyard)
  - Monster Mash: Part 3 (Frostburn Canyon)  
  - Neither Rain Nor Sleet Nor Skags (Three Horns - Valley)
	
_**Note:** As for my Double Quest Reward "Redux", this Mod will give you the choice between 2 weapons/items instead of a single one, so it will double the chance to get a weapon/item with desired parts._

### Changelog:

- v1.0.0, September 2, 2018
  - Initial public release

### Compatibility:

- 100% compatible with UCP 4.1
- Should be compatible with most other mods, as long as they do not touch the Quest Reward.
- This mod was tested -and work nicely!- with:
  -[UCP Patch](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Community%20Patch%20Team)   
  -[Better Quest](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/blob/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Hemaxhu/Quest%20Rewards/Better%20Quests) by [Hemaxu](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Hemaxhu) .

To be sure to get this mod working correctly (as intended), don't forget to place it **AFTER** UCP 4.1 and Better Quest. 

**Know Issue:** Gemstone Rewards instead of E-Tech Rewards.

- To "trick" the E-Tech weapon rewards with only few weapons by type available (Splatgun: 1 Bandit, 1 Hyperion & 1 Tediore - Total 3 Splatgun for all brands), I use the following E-Tech pool:

```
GD_Itempools.WeaponPools.Pool_Weapons_AssaultRifles_05_VeryRare_Alien
GD_Itempools.WeaponPools.Pool_Weapons_Launchers_05_VeryRare_Alien
GD_Itempools.WeaponPools.Pool_Weapons_Pistols_05_VeryRare_Alien
GD_Itempools.WeaponPools.Pool_Weapons_Shotguns_05_VeryRare_Alien
GD_Itempools.WeaponPools.Pool_Weapons_SMG_05_VeryRare_Alien
GD_Itempools.WeaponPools.Pool_Weapons_SnipersRifles_05_VeryRare_Alien
```

Apocalyptech's "Better Loot" & "Cold Dead Hands" mod aren't incompatible with my mod, but they use the same E-Tech pools to inject Gemstone weapons on it... so if you receive a Gemstone weapon instead of a E-Tech weapon, you know the reason.

Unfortunately, there is no way I can fix that, so the best thing to do in this case is probably to disable my mod (but don't worry, it's not a big deal!) or toggle off the "Add Gemstones to E-Tech Pools" option in BL & CDH... the choice is your.

### To do:

- [x] Check twice if I don't forget a Dr Zed mission somewhere.
- [ ] Make (again) a new playthrough to be sure that all the rewards are given correctly.
- [ ] Clean the code and remove all my ~~shitty~~ notes.
