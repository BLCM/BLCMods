## Moxxi Signature Elegance Collection

The idea is really very simple as it come from the *Santos*, a well know French jeweller watch.

First, I take the red color similar to the little Cartier box, next I made the metal part looking like (silver) steel... add some discrete decorative gold parts like the golden screws inserted into a brushed steel bracelet... finally adapt the Moxxi logo in a more appropriate size when necessary... and repeat the same work on all the Moxxi weapons...
