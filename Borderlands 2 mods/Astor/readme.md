## Bonjour

I'm Astor, and I apologize in advance for some grammar and/or syntax errors, but my mother tongue is French.

This Read Me is just here as a quick synopsis, for detailed informations, each Mod has is own Read Me (and even a Changelog), so don't hesitate -whoosh!- to give a look on it.

## [Quest Reward] [Double Quest Reward Redux v1.0.3]

 - Upgrade the customization skin/head rewards to a Blue weapon/item rewards for 9 missions.
 - Choice between 2 Unique weapons/items instead of a single one, so it will double the chance to get a Unique weapon/item with desired parts.
 - In the mission Uncle Teddy, if you give the plans to Hyperion you will have the choice between 2 options: The Bitch (Legendary SMG Hyperion) or The Commerce (Unique Shock SMG Hyperion)

 ## [New Weapon] [SMG Dahl Discord Solver - Lascaux Version v1.0.0]

In their early days in the making of weapons, Dahl, in collaboration with Torgue create the Discord Solver, a SMG who fire explosive bullet. 
Unfortunately, the agreement between the two weapons manufacturers did not last long, and the production of the SMG stopped quickly -How ironic for a weapon that's named Discord Solver!- and Torgue created the Pocket Rocket.

Anyway, remnant of the past, a *"lost"* Discord Solver (probably dropped by a bandit?) can still be found... submerged in a shallow pool in Frostburn Canyon.

 ## [New Weapon] [SMG Dahl Discord Solver - Moxxi Version v1.0.0]

 It would seem that Moxxi still has a specimen of the Discord Solver in her private Signature collection of weapons, but no one has ever seen it, not even Marcus ... so maybe it's just a legend after all? 
 
 ... or perhaps this weapon can become the reward given by Moxxi for the mission "Hell Hath No Fury" in Opportunity...  Who know?
