## Plasma Caster Hyperion Finesse - Moxxi Edition


To help keep them competitive in a world that demands element-matching, Hyperion Hyperion hired a top-notch research & development team to revert the Alien technology and created a experimental bullet wrapped in a plasma projectile: the SEAPP (Smart Elemental Adaptive Plasma Projectile) which was capable of adapt itself to whichever type of resistance the enemy had.

Short time after, they created the *Finesse*: a Plasma Caster able to fire SEAPP (Smart Elemental Adaptive Plasma Projectile). 

Unfortunately, the mastery of the Elemental technology was in its infancy, and especially very expensive, making the price of sale of this weapons totally prohibitive, and therefore unavailable to the majority of bandits, which involved the production stoppage of this revolutionary Plasma Caster only after a few (rare) copies sold.

### Where to find it?

The *Plasma Caster Hyperion Finesse* can be a drop from Assassin Wot fought during the side mission *Assassinate the Assassins* (Southpaw Steam & Power)... and can also drop from (the same) Assassin Wot at the end of the *A History of Simulated Violence* mission (Digistruct Peak)... or can become the reward given by Moxxi for the mission "Hell Hath No Fury" in Opportunity (see in *options* below)

**Note:** Yep! Assassin Wot is this guy... butf you are too lazy to fight him, you will find the Gibbed Codes below.

### What special with this weapon?

- Fire SEAPP (Smart Elemental Adaptive Plasma Projectile) exploding only in contact with a enemy and adapting his Elemental Splash following the kind of impact:
  - Incendiary on flesh
  - Shock on shield
  - Corrosive on armor
- Elemental splash damage boosted by grenade (only when hitting a enemy).
- Shot one SEAPP for the cost of 2 ammo (can be doubled if you use the Aaron00000's "Double Anarchy" mod).
- Cosmetic:
  - MuzzleFlash upgraded to Plasma Caster.
  - E-Tech Elemental Color Glow ("inside" the flaps).
  - Firing Mode Sound upgraded to Plasma Caster sound.
- As usual for the Vanilla Moxxi weapons, this Moxxi Plasma Caster will give you the benefice of:
  - 70% Critical hit bonus
  - 2.5% lifesteal on damage dealt 
  - Spawn with the *Miss Moxxi's* prefix

Not clear? ... Well, perhaps it will be more easy to compare the difference in a table:
