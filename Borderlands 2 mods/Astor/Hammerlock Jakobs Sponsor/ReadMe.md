## Hammerlock Jakobs Sponsor

### What do this mod?

- The 8 missions given by Hammerlock in the main game will be rewarded with a Jakobs weapon/item
  - In the Mission Bad Hair Day (Southern Shelf) the reward is now a Blue Sniper Jakobs (if the fur is given to Hammerlock) or a Blue Shotgun Torgue (if the fur is given to Clap-Trap).
  - The reward for the other missions given by Hammerlock are now rewarded by a Blue Jakobs weapon/item:   
    - Mighty Morphin' (Tundra Express)
    - Perfectly Peaceful (Caustic caverns)   
    - Shielded Favors (Southern Shelf)	  
    - Symbiosis (Southern Shelf)	  
    - The Name Game (Three Horns - Divide)	  
    - This Town Ain't Big Enough (Southern Shelf)
	
_**Note:** This Mod will give you the choice between 2 weapons/items instead of a single one, so it will double the chance to get a weapon/item with desired parts._	

_**Another Note:** The Slap Happy, even if it's a Hammerlock mission will keep his Unique Shotgun Octo Reward... for now!_
