## Discord Solver (Lascaux & Moxxi Version)

In their early days in their making of weapons, Dahl, in collaboration with Torgue created the Discord Solver, a SMG who shot GyroJet explosive bullet. 

Unfortunately, the agreement between the two weapons manufacturers did not last long, and the production of the SMG stopped quickly -How ironic for a weapon that's named Discord Solver!- and Torgue seized the patents to create the Pocket Rocket.

It would seem that Moxxi still has a specimen of the Discord Solver in her private Signature collection of weapons, but no one has ever seen it, not even Marcus ... so maybe it's just a legend after all?

Anyway, remnant of the past, a *"lost"* Discord Solver (probably dropped by a bandit?) can still be found... submerged in a shallow pool in Frostburn Canyon.

This is where you can find it...

## What special with this weapon?

- Both Version:
  - Keep (almost) of all his Unique weapon specificity: very high firerate, variable burst-fire round, shot two bullets for the cost of one ammo, etc... for more details, see [Borderlands Wiki](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Lascaux) 
  - Initial damage reduced by 20%, but...
    - FireMode modified to shoot the Pocket Rocket GyroJet Explosive bullet. 
    - Shot two GyroJet explosive bullet simultaneously for the cost of one ammo (can be doubled if you use the Aaron00000's "Double Anarchy" mod).
	- Explosion Radius incrasead by 50%.
    - Impact Explosion boosted by Grenade Damage.
    - Firing Mode Sound upgraded to GyroJet Explosive bullet sound (less Ratatatatatata and more Kaboom)	
- Moxxi Version:
  - As usual for the Vanilla Moxxi weapons, this Moxxi SMG will give you the benefice of:
    - 70% Critical hit bonus
    - 2.5% lifesteal on damage dealt. 
	
Not clear? ... Well, perhaps it will be more easy to compare the difference in a table:

**Note:** As the Discord Solver can be found submerged in a shallow pool in a cave, it's make sense to me to keep his Vanilla "Lascaux" skin (similar to the Lascaux cave paintings), but the Moxxi version, she get a ~~vivid red~~ ... gorgeous Moxxi Signature skin.

### Options: 

This Mod has few options & fix, so feel free to use the BLCMM tool to select the best option that suit you.

  - The Bullet Speed Mode has a toggle option between Normal/Double/Triple Speed
  - The Explosion Impact Type has a toggle option between Explosive/Explosive ForceFlinch/None

  - The Moxxi Signature *Cartier* Edition ("Red Cartier" in the style from the renowned French jeweler) which is very stylish and sophisticated, and by the way the all time favorite from Aurelia the Baroness.
- The Discord Solver Moxxi Edition can become the reward given by Moxxi for the mission "Hell Hath No Fury" in Opportunity (see picture below).

... and few fix:

![Discord Solver as reward for Moxxi mission](https://i.imgur.com/8JPt8ap.png "Don't worry guys... even if my screen capture show French text, my mods are in English") 

**Note:** You can toggle between the choice from 2 Moxxi Discord Solver or between the choice from 1 Moxxi Discord Solver & 1 Kiss of Death. 

### Compatibility:

- 100% compatible with [UCP Patch](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Community%20Patch%20Team)

- Should be compatible with most other mods, as long as they do not modify the Pocket Rocket Firing Mode.

- Just be aware from the following:

  - To be sure to get the fix Orudeon's Bayonet Enhancements and/or Orudeon's Bayonet Buff working correctly (as intended), don't forget to place my mod **AFTER** Orudeon's Bayonet Enhancements & Bayonet Buff. 
 
  - This Mod **KEEP** the specific burst from the Lascaux, so if you use the Bandit Brand Tweaks v1.2 by Orudeon, there is a option that reduce the burst to five-shot bursts.  To get back the specific burst, just open your Orudeon's Bandit Brand Tweaks folder, go to: *SMG/Burst Count/* (if you use the Gears Overhaul Orudeon's Mod v1.35, the path will be: *Brands Tweaks/Bandit Brand Tweaks v1.2 by Orudeon/SMG/Burst Count/*) and uncheck the following line:  
  ```
  [ ] set GD_Weap_SMG.Barrel.SMG_Barrel_Bandit_Lascaux ZoomWeaponAttributeEffects ((AttributeToModify = AttributeDefinition'D_Attributes.Weapon.WeaponAutomaticBurstCount',ModifierType = MT_PreAdd,BaseModifierValue = (BaseValueConstant = 1.000000, BaseValueAttribute = None, InitializationDefinition = None, BaseValueScaleConstant = 1.000000)))
  ``` 
  - This mod use the Pocket Rocket Firing Mode, so if you use any mode that changes the attributes from the Pocket Rocket, it will affect this mod, and obviously the firing of the Discord Solver. In this case, Just revert the modification done previously to the Pocket Rocket.
  
  - This mode use Grenade Damage for the Splash Format, so if you are going to use the Discord Solver with a Siren character :warning: Maya :warning: , don't forget to toggle the Grenade Damage to Reaper Splash Damage.
  
### Other Recommended Mods:

A great mod to check for the Discord Solver:

- Moxxi Version: [No More Moxxi Lifesteal v2.0](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/blob/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Akathris/NoMoreMoxxiLifestealv2.0.txt) by [Akathris](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Akathris) . His Mod is self explanatory: removes lifesteal from Moxxi weapons and changes it to passive health regeneration.

- Both Version: [Double Anarchy v4](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/blob/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Aaron0000/Weapon-Item%20Parts%20and%20Accessories/DoubleAnarchyv4.txt) by [Aaron00000](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Aaron0000) : Changes the SMGs accuracy accessory into the Double Accessory from Borderlands 1... and your Discord Solver will shot 4 bullets/projectiles at the cost on 2 ammo.
