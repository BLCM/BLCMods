## Credits:

I am __NOT__ the author for the mods listed above, and I __DON'T__ modify them in any way... so I cannot be held responsible if the Mod blow up in your face! 

Undeniably, to create such great mods, all the credits go to each respective authors... but perhaps I deserve a little credit too... at least to translate the new/additional line(s) of code ```Description``` in French without doing (too much) spelling mistakes :smirk:
