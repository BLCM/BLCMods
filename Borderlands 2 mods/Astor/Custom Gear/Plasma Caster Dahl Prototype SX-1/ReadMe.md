## Plasma Caster Dahl Prototype SX-1 
 
After the commercial failure of the Discord Solver, a rogue engineer at Dahl took the plans and secretly worked on the realization of a Plasma Caster capable of firing explosive projectiles Gyrojet coated in a plasma ball.

The prototype was really a powerful and dangerous weapon, except that the plasma ball will only explose when in contact with a enemy and the missed shots disintegrate instantly -without exploding!- in a tiny cloud of pink smoke.

Remorseful of his dishonest activity, he decided to get rid of his prototype forever by submerged it in a shallow pool in a cave in Frostburn Canyon.

This is where you can find it....

**Note:** If you are too lazy to walk to Frostburn Canyon, you will find the Gibbed Codes below.


## What special with this weapon?

- Keep the typical fire pattern from the Lascaux Unique Dahl SMG (for more details, see [Borderlands Wiki](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Lascaux)) mixed  with the Plasma caster specificity, and get the chance to shot a extra explosive plasma projectile for the cost of two ammo.
- Initial (too good) accuracy reduced, slower fireate, and slower reload, but...
  - FireMode modified to shoot the Pocket Rocket GyroJet Explosive Bullet embedded in a plasma ball (but exploding only in contact with a enemy). 
  - The speed from the GyroJet Explosive bullet is 3x faster when fired by a E-Tech Plasma Caster than a Pocket Rocket pistol (but it's still a lot more slower than a normal projectile fired by a Plasma Caster) 
  - Chance  to shot two explosive plasma projectile simultaneously for the cost of two ammo (can be doubled if you use the Aaron00000's "Double Anarchy" mod).
  - Impact Explosion boosted by Grenade Damage (only when hitting a enemy).
   - Firing Mode Sound upgraded to Plasma Caster sound.
   - MuzzleFlash upgraded to Plasma Caster.
   - Explosive Elemental Color Glow (similar to Torgue weapons)

Not clear? ... Well, perhaps it will be more easy to compare the difference in a table:

**Note:** Those who are a little bit curious will recognize the inspiration from the name (SX-1) and the skin color (Blue/Grey & White) coming straight from the Belgian comics book "The Adventures of Blake & Mortimer: The Secret of the Swordfish" by E.P. Jacobs.

This Mod has few options & fix, so feel free to use the BLCMM tool to select the best option that suit you.
- The Splash Format has a toggle option between Grenade/Rocket/Reaper (see Compatibility below)
- The Weapon Card has a toggle option between English/French.
- The Explosive Elemental Color Glow has a toggle option between On/Off
- Fix for Koby "Rarity Color Fix": AfterMarket (just in case if you use this old mod)

### Changelog:

- v1.0.0, October 1, 2018
  - Initial public release
  
### Compatibility:

- 100% compatible with [UCP Patch](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Community%20Patch%20Team)

- Should be compatible with most other mods, as long as they do not modify the Pocket Rocket Firing Mode.

- Just be aware from the following:

  - This mod use the *Pocket Rocket Explosive GyroJet Firing Mode*, so if you use any mode that changes the attributes from the Pocket Rocket Firing Mode, it will affect this mod, and obviously the firing of the Prototype SX-1. In this case, Just revert the modification done previously to the Pocket Rocket Firing Mode.
  
  - This mode use Grenade Damage for the Splash Format, so if you are going to use the Prototype SX-1 with a Siren character :warning: Maya :warning: , don't forget to toggle the Grenade Damage to Reaper Splash Damage.
   
### Other Recommended Mods:

A great mod to check for the Prototype SX-1 Bloody version:

- [More Blood](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/blob/a3706b44e0ab31632eb04bdc5056b57ae66f3a27/Borderlands%202%20mods/Juso/moreblood.blcm) by [Juso](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/a3706b44e0ab31632eb04bdc5056b57ae66f3a27/Borderlands%202%20mods/Juso) : because after you have exploded your enemies, only blood will remain.

### To do:

- [x] Make a nice and shiny SX-1 skin.
- [ ] Clean the code and remove all my ~~shitty~~ smart notes. 
- [ ] Make (again) few kills to be sure that the submachine gun work correctly.
