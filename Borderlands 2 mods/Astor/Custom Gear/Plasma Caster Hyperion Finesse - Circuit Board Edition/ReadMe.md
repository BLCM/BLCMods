## Plasma Caster Hyperion Finesse - Circuit Board Edition

In their early days in their making of weapons, Hyperion, seized Alien Technology plans and created the Finesse: a Plasma Caster which fire SEAPP (Smart Elemental Adaptive Plasma Projectile). 

Unfortunately, the mastery of this Alien technology was in its infancy, and especially very expensive, which made the price of sale of these weapons totally prohibitive, and therefore unavailable to the majority of bandits, which involved the production stoppage of this revolutionary Plasma Caster only after a few (rare) copies sold.

## Where to find it?

The Plasma Caster Hyperion Finesse can be a drop from Assassin Wot fought during the side mission *Assassinate the Assassins* (Southpaw Steam & Power)... and can also drop from (the same) Assassin Wot at the end of the *A History of Simulated Violence* mission (Digistruct Peak).

**Note:** If you are too lazy to fight Assassin Wot, you will find the Gibbed Codes below.

## What special with this weapon?

- Fire SEAPP (Smart Elemental Adaptive Plasma Projectile) exploding only in contact with a enemy: a Alien Plasma Projectile which adapt his Elemental following the kind of impact:
  - Incendiary on flesh
  - Shock on shield
  - Corrosive on armor
- Elemental splash damage boosted by grenade (only when hitting a enemy).
- Shot one SEAPP for the cost of 2 ammo (can be doubled if you use the Aaron00000's "Double Anarchy" mod).
- Cosmetic:
  - MuzzleFlash upgraded to Plasma Caster.
  - E-Tech Elemental Color Glow ("inside" the flaps).
  - Firing Mode Sound upgraded to Plasma Caster sound.
  
Not clear? ... Well, perhaps it will be more easy to compare the difference in a table:

**Note:** You can toggle between the choice from 2 *Plasma Caster Finesse- Circuit Board Edition* or between the choice from 1 *Plasma Caster Finesse- Circuit Board Edition* & 1 SMG *Bitch* (Legendary).

## Compatibility:

- 100% compatible with [UCP Patch](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Community%20Patch%20Team).
- Just be aware from the following:
  - This mod use the following Firing Mode: Pocket Rocket/Tinderbox/Hornet/Twister, so if you use any mod wich changes the attributes from any of these Firing Mode, it will affect this mod, and obviously the firing of the Finesse. In this case, just revert the modification done previously to these Firing Mode.
  - This mode use Grenade Damage for the Splash Format, so if you are going to use the Plasma Caster Finesse with a Siren character :warning: Maya :warning: , don't forget to toggle the Grenade Damage to Reaper Splash Damage.
  - This Mod as a option which make the *Discord Solver - Circuit Board Edition* becoming the reward given by Hyperion for the mission *Uncle Teddy*  in Arid Nexus - Badlands, so be sure that you place this mod **AFTER** my mod *Double Quest Reward Redux* or any other mod modifying the Quest Reward.
