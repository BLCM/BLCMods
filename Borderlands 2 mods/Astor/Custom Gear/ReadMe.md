## [Custom Weapon] Plasma Caster Dahl Prototype SX-1

The Prototype SX-1 was great and really a powerful and dangerous weapon, except that the plasma ball will only explode when coming in contact with a enemy and the missed shots disintegrate instantly "pschitt" like a damp squib (without exploding!) in a tiny cloud of pink smoke.

## [Custom Weapon] SMG Dahl Discord Solver - Bloody Edition

In their early days in the making of weapons, Dahl, in collaboration with Torgue create the Discord Solver, a SMG who fire explosive bullet.
  
Unfortunately, the agreement between the two weapons manufacturers did not last long, and the production of the SMG stopped quickly -How ironic for a weapon that's named Discord Solver!- and Torgue created the Pocket Rocket.

Anyway, remnant of the past, a *"lost"* Discord Solver (probably dropped by a bandit?) can still be found... submerged in a shallow pool in Frostburn Canyon.

## [Custom Weapon] SMG Dahl Discord Solver - Moxxi Edition

It would seem that Moxxi still has a specimen of the Discord Solver in her private Signature collection of weapons, but no one has ever seen it, not even Marcus... so maybe it's just a legend after all? 
 
... or perhaps this weapon can become the reward given by Moxxi for the mission "Hell Hath No Fury" in Opportunity...  Who know?

## [Custom Weapon] SMG Hyperion Splish Splash - Stendhal Edition

A SMG which fire SEAMB (Smart Elemental Adaptive Maliwan Bullet), a Elemental Explosive bullet adapting his Elemental following the kind of impact: Incendiary on flesh / Shock on shield / Corrosive on armor... and Explosive on anything else.
