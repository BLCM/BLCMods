Installation / Usage
--------------------

An written installation tutorial can be found on the official modding Github
wiki: <https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/wiki/Tutorial%3A-Enabling-Console>

A video installation guide can be found on Youtube: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2E_WD7zAYs>

There is one patch file for download: `Patch.txt`.

You don't need any DLC for the UCP to work but many changes won't apply if
you don't have them and errors are bound to appear.

You can also use BLCMM to disable features of the patch that you do not like,
so it is fully customizable.

**For any form of Borderlands 2 modding, it is highly recommended to use
LightChaosman's BLCMM which can be found here: <https://www.dropbox.com/sh/rsljh5c55s8e9ah/AABMuarIfYCxJb8GiSY1IF6La?dl=0>**
