Linux Users shouldn't update! You need to wait until the DLC hits first, then you may update. Or some unintended stuff might happen.

***************************General Stuff************************

1.	Included a new message in the Badass Rank section to make sure your Patch is properly activated.
2.	Changed the Toothpick to have the correct muzzle flash.
3.	Retainer is no longer area restricted and also correctly says its unique effect.
4.	Buttstallion now drops her legendaries again.
5.	Less Cluttering Particles updated.
6.	Fixed the Infection Cleaner's Skin.
7.	Fixed Unrecognized Objects popping up when executing the Patch.

9.	Spikers/Darts no longer display their health bar when shooting.
