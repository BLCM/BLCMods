5.0.2 Fix Changelog:

- Removed any changes concerning "global drop rarity constants" fixes.
   -> The idea was to fix certain inconsistencies by Gearbox which made loot pools use flat values instead of the usual attribute for the drop rate. It was a modder's resource and didn't affect gameplay, but was confusing for lots of people.
   -> Unknown to us, this broke Tubby COM drop chance and accidentally set it to 20% instead of 100%, which was fixed now.
- Fixed two minor bugs.

5.0.1 Fix Changelog:

- Fixed some scaling issues which caused slag and other elemental effects to barely trigger.
