You may be wondering why each and every Maya COM that I created replaces the Legendary Nurse. I made it this way so you can execute any of the COM commands while playing the game. (It was also much easier to test and develop the COM's this way, for me atleast)

For example if you are using Legendary Specter, but want to switch over to a Pistol based build, you can simply type 'exec FileName(Desperado COM) and it will update the COM after re equipping it ingame.

If you want the satisfaction of farming each COM individually feel free to play the game with another class mod, execute the command for your desired COM that you wish to farm (AKA Legendary Plaguebearer) and get to killing those Tubbies until they drop a Legendary Nurse.

Legendary Tempest Disclaimer:
This COM may or may not interfere with your other installed mods as the 'Chance to Shock' stat is a DLC luxury and not part of the Vanilla game. Is there a fix for this? I have no idea. But shout out to SirUmnei for making this COM possible.

I'm still new to modding in Borderlands 2 but I hope to improve as I develop more mods. I started out with COM's because I feel like they were easy to learn and thanks to the BL2 modding community I had a huge canvas to work with.

ENJOY!
