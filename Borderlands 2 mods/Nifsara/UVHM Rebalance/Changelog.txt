        A comma,

2018/01/13: v.1.666

        Updated both standard versions to actually work as expected at level 73+.
        Made optional UVHM+ modules for use with the UVHM+ main mod. As always, place my "Enemy Scaling" at the very bottom.
        
2018/01/12: v.1.5

        Made two versions with different scalings. 
        
        Regular: Enemies end up 50% weaker than vanilla UVHM. They start scaling from level 32 and stop at 50.
        Hard: Enemies end up 25% weaker than vanilla UVHM. They start scaling from level 2 and stop at level 50.

2018/01/12: v.1.2

        Enemy scaling has been retouched to be less punishing early on, when weapons and shields are scant.
        Slag damage has been reduced to 0.85 across the board.
        Axton's Sabre Turret has been made immune to the Slag debuff.
        Gaige's Deathtrap has been made immune to the Slag debuff.

2018/01/12: v.1.11

        Accidentally made Slag too weak against shielded targets.
        
2018/01/11: v.1.1

        Major update already?!
        
        -Enemy health and shield balanced for real. Let me know if it's okay now.
        -Movement speed penalty when slagged increased to 100% (halving movement speed).
        -Slag on shield damage buffed to 0.9.
        -Slag has been given a hidden multiplicative bonus of 25% chance to be applied universally (except on player).
        -Double ammo drop didn't work.
        
2018/01/11: v.1.01

        Badass health nerfed somewhat due to bosses and no Slag bonus damage. Needs further testing.

2018/01/11: v.1.0 - Initial release

        This mod is far from finished. I've spent more time in the Filter Tool than I have in-game. Things are probably going to be very unbalanced until I play through the game or get some feedback at various level brackets.
