 # Legendary Anarchist
 Uh this is litteraly my very first mod ever and thus is not perfect by any means :P I might someday fix the UI now that i know how.
 It does one thing tho that i believe gaige players WOULD love and that is :
 
 Removes Strenght of Five Gorillas And Replaces Preshrunk Cyberpunk on the Legendary Anarchist Class mod.
 A melee Boost made no sense to that CoM so i gave it an Actual anarchy skill
 UI WONT SHOW IT BUT THE SKILL IS INDEED BUFFED IF YOU GO TO SKILL LIST
 
 # GrogNozzleMissionReward
 Litteraly my second mod :P i had forgotten to upload it in since... forever so here it is now.
 Makes the grog a mission reward from the Beard makes the wizard.
