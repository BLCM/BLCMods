Welcome to my collection of little and misc mods!

This is where I'll be keeping all my gear that's either too small or doesn't really have a place anywhere else.

Currently Includes:

[-- AGL Loaders --]

- Changes the name of Angelic Guards to AGL Loaders, that's it

- The why was because it really annoys me that every loader in the game has ___ Loader
- But Angelic Guards are unchanged, since they roam around in TVHM and UVHM

[-- Flame of the Firehawk Skin --]

- A simple change to the FOTF to give it the purple Dahl skin
- It gives it a similar look to the Sunshine from TPS as well as adding a fire look

[-- Krusty Krawmerax Challenge --]

- This mod is made for those who enjoy the adventure of farming for the Norfleet and the Twister, very strong and but very hard to get.
- Since there's no real reason to farm Son of Crawmerax, I decided to give him a unique pearlescent rocket launcher called the Crab Cannon which is an   extremely rare drop.

NOTE: Since this is an elemental Torgue weapon, it goes against sanity check, so if you load into the game without the mod activated, the weapon will be deleted, so just gibb it back in if that happens.
NOTE: Messes with Master Gee, for some reason he doesn't deal any damage, there's probably a fix so i'll patch it in later.

Features:
- Renames Son of Crawmerax to Krusty Krawmerax
- Adds a new rocket launcher that replaces the Error Message
- Gives Son of Crawmerax a unique drop that's extremely rare

Weapon Features:
- Shoots E-tech railgun bullets, 50 of them
- Can headshot
- Focuses more single targets than groups
- Comes in all elements except none and explosive
