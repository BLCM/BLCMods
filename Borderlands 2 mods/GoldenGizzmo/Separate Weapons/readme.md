Welcome to my weapon collection!

This is where I'll be keeping all my seperate new weapons that I've created.

Currently Includes:

[-- The Capacitor --]

. Replaces the Triquetra
. An E-tech Jakobs shotgun
. Has no element and shoots like a normal shotgun, except with blaster shots
. The magazine size is as big as the max ammo carry load, removing reloading
. However to add new ammo, you need to reload
. Overtime ammo will regenerate

. This whole idea is represented in the description as "charge".
. To fit the energy gimmick, reloading adds charge back into the weapon, over time the weapon stockpiles charge to reload.
. Since Jakobs hates weaponry that aren't 'normal', they treat this weapon as a forbidden alien artifact that should be locked away from public view, similar   to America and the rumours of Area 51.
. Since the weapon has an almost endless magazine size, the player can really just mash the shoot button, of course it's only really effective at close range.

. Special credit to Exotek for fixing the flaps and some skin errors

[-- The Gizzmo --]

. Replaces the Pocket Rocket
. Shoots 2 bullets instead of 1
. A torgue pistol that fires like a Jakobs pistol

. This is the first gun i've ever made, and it's named after my cat, just like my username.
. Since the weapon fires like a Jakobs pistol, the DPS acheived can be very high if the player is good at mashing.
. The gun is purple rarity to stand out in the Torgue Vendors.
. Now shoots standard Torgue gyrojets to be more compatible with other mods.

[-- Java Powerhouse --]

. Replaces the Black Hole
. A huge change to the Black Hole shield
. Lower capacity
. Insanely high recharge rate
. Higher recharge delay
. Much higher nova damage

. The shield is a mixture of the Black Hole, Rapid Release and Supernova.
. It's now made for a much higher offense.
. The recharge rate is increase in order for the nova to proc more often.
. Mostly nova shields do dissapointing damage at higher levels, hence the massive increase in power, yet it's not insane enough to make Gaige invincible.

[-- The Switch It! --]

. Replaces the Deliverence
. Only shoots one bullet
. Has a magazine size of 1
. On reload, throws 10 shotguns

. So obviously the gimmick with this weapon is that I've swapped the bullets fired with the guns thrown.
. Hence the name.
. Also the design of the gun looked similar to a bunch of Nintendo Switches being thrown around.
. Since Switch fits the name, I then also made the gun have the same colour scheme.
. This gun is not meant for shooting, but chucking like other tediore weapons.
