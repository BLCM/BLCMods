First of all, i'd like to have some feedback, i don't even know if there's anyone playing my mods,
does any even like my weaponry? or if you like the old brokenish golden skin i used to put on every weapon? 
i really don't know.

Rule No.1 for my mods is, to make them compatible with my other mods, if i can, but sometimes i can't, so here's a list of my mods
that should not be activated at the same time:
Limit Break And T2000 Concept
Dahl Silver And T2000 Concept
Atomic Mortar And Nukem Mortar MKII

I make 1-2 mods daily, and if you have any questions, or if you want a new weaponry, or make adjustments to a current mod,
you can contact me via discord, my discord is: Tsunami#7900

My time zone is UTC +9:00 btw
