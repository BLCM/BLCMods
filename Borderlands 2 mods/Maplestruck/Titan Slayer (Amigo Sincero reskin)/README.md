This mod was initially made for personal use, and so it may not be the best quality. Thank you for understanding.

Made as a tribute to my devoutly Christian dear friend in real life. Some people think this gun is unbalanced. I think its strength makes perfect sense. After all, it is a gift sent from Heaven, fit for a holy warrior.

This gun was inspired by the Gottschalk ("servant of God") from The Reckoners novel series. Its parts are how I picture the Gottschalk would look like, only with new pure white paint and a gold plated body. The critical bipod is not visible.

Titanent√∂ter means "Titan Slayer" in German, and refers to this gun's oneshot potential as well as its utility against raid bosses. Since the Amigo Sincero normally cannot have a prefix, I added one in the title. This also assumes you use the critical bipod with the gun.  The prefix "Entschlossener" is a German equivalant of Tumtum. It has many meanings in German, most of which are along the lines of "determined", "resolute" and "strong-willed". In some ways, the true gift of a close friend is the strength to knock down even the strongest adversary.
