This mod was initially made for personal use, and so it may not be the best quality. Thank you for understanding.

Made as a tribute to my devoutly Christian dear friend in real life. Some people think this gun is unbalanced. I think its strength makes perfect sense. After all, it is a gift sent from Heaven, fit for a holy warrior.

This gun was inspired by the Gottschalk ("servant of God") from The Reckoners novel series. Its parts are how I picture the Gottschalk would look like, only with new pure white paint and a gold plated body. The critical bipod is not visible.

Titanentöter means "Titan Slayer" in German, and refers to this gun's oneshot potential as well as its utility against raid bosses. Since the Amigo Sincero normally cannot have a prefix, I added one in the title. This also assumes you use the critical bipod with the gun.  The prefix "Entschlossener" is a German equivalant of Tumtum. It has many meanings in German, most of which are along the lines of "determined", "resolute" and "strong-willed". In some ways, the true gift of a close friend is the strength to knock down even the strongest adversary.
