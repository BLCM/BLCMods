Hi !

I'm PsychoPatate,
that would be PsychoTato in English, but I'm French.

This readme is just here so you know that there are readme files in every mod folder I'll make.

But here is a quick synopsis :

- ProperWeaponBodies :
	- Swaps green and blue weapon bodies because that makes more sense like this.
	- Allows you to change some weapon bodies because they have unique bodies so why not.
	- ONLY VISUAL CHANGES, NO ACTUAL STATS ARE AFFECTED.

- MatchingBarrels : (not out yet)
	- Changes every unique weapon barrel so it matches its manufacturer (Sand Hawk gets a Dahl barrel).
	- But doesn't change some Shotgun barrels because it wouldn't make sense anymore.
	- ONLY VISUAL CHANGES, NO ACTUAL STATS ARE AFFECTED.
