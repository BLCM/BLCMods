------LEVEL 1 UVHM------

By Koby

This mod allows you to play in UVHM from level 1 with all UVHM modifiers active and all level restrictions lifted.

Has three difficulty options you can pick from with the Filter Tool (defaults to vanilla difficulty).

WARNING: THIS IS VERY HARD AND YOU WILL SUFFER IN THE EARLY LEVELS AND PROBABLY FURTHER INTO THE GAME. MODS LIKE VENDORS+ BY THENOCTURNI OR VENDORS ENHANCED BY ME ARE HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. MODS LIKE ENEMYENHANCER MAKE THIS EXTREMELY HARD.

Credit to Shadowevil for providing the hexcode and the UVHM modifier code and Nifsara for the save files and the balanced difficulty.

------INSTALLATION------

To make this work you need to do three things:

1. Hexedit 430083FE32 into 430083FE01 in your Borderlands2.exe

2. Place a pre-set save file into your Borderlands 2 save directory (usually at \Documents\My Games\Borderlands 2\WillowGame\SaveData\<########...>)

3. Download and merge the Level 1 UVHM.txt mod like any other mod (contains hotfixes so mod merging is needed if you run multiple hotfixed mods)

The included save files are needed because they have UVHM and the two Weapon slots unlocked.
