Maya received a minor rework to make her playstyle feel more "active".

Mostly reworked Cataclysm.

Built from the UCP and my own changes.

Skill trees have the TPS skill layout now.

Skills also have nicely colored text now.

------------------------PHASELOCK------------------------
- Maya can now Phaselock more enemies and deals more damage to enemies she can't Phaselock. (From theNocturni's Phaselock mod)
- Phaselock's Damage now scales properly, as well as most grade-based Damage skills.

------------------------MOTION------------------------
- Accelerate: Increased Gun Damage to 4% per point from 3% per point.
- Inertia: Now Tier 2 skill in Motion.
- Sub-Sequence: Now Tier 4 skill in Motion.
- Quicken: Now additionally increases Weapon Swap Speed by 6% per point.
- Kinetic Reflection: Now Tier 5 skill in Motion. Deflection Chance is now 20% per point instead of 100% flat, but Damage Reduction is increased to 15% per point from 10% per point.

------------------------CATACLYSM------------------------

- Void Portal (previously Helios): Now Tier 4 gamechanger in Cataclysm. Phaselocking and enemy causes a slag explosion, slagging all nearby enemies.
- Backdraft: Increased the Nova Damage by 30% and the Melee Damage by 800%. Don't worry, it's still not very good LOL.
- Blight Phoenix: Increased the Damage by roughly 150%. Now additionally gives bullet regeneration while active, 0.3 bullets per second per point.
- Ruin: No longer slags the Phaselocked target but instead burns it (Burn -> Electrocute -> Corrode. Void Portal activates before this.).
