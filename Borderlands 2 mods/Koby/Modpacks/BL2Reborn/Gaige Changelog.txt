A mix between the UCP changes, AngrierPat's Unofficial Gaige Rework and my changes.

TL;DR: Power shifted around the skill trees and skill trees are put more in line; Overall, Best Friends Forever and Little Big Trouble are stronger now and Ordered Chaos is weaker.

Skill trees have the TPS skill layout now.

Skills also have nicely colored text now.
