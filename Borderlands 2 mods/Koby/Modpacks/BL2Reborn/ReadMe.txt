If you want to experience Borderlands 2 in a new way, this modpack is exactly for you.

!!!THE UCP IS INCLUDED IN THIS STOP MERGING THE UCP INTO BL2 REBORN PLEASE READ THE MODLIST LOL!!!

The version 1.2 is in BETA and features some additional features and was fully build from scratch with BLCMM. Please report any bugs and anomalies to @Koby in Discord.

Download the modpack by rightclicking the "Download" button in "BL2Reborn.txt" and "Save link as...".

You can enable optional mods at the bottom of the modpack with BLCMM.

Lots of options are hand-picked by me. Don't enable/disable stuff unless you know exactly what you're doing!

Use on an existing save file at your own risk, make a backup. Items can and will disappear.

!!!WARNING!!!
I !!!HIGHLY!!! recommend using BLCMM for everything you're doing with this modpack

I also !!!HIGHLY!!! recommend using the Hex Multitool to disable Sanity Checks

If you need help using BLCMM on BL2 Reborn, check out my video on it (outdated but should still work)
